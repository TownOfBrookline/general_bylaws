(c)  The Commissioner shall provide a permit application
     form which shall be completed by every person who

     Town of Brookline.  The form shall require the
     applicant to provide the following information:

          (1)  a description sufficient to show the precise
               address and location of each newsrack and
               whether or not it is attached to town-owned
               property;

          (2)  the name, address and telephone number of
               the owner of each newsrack and the name,
               address and telephone number of a person
               responsible for the maintenance and
               operation of the newsrack who may be

               and the newsrack comply with the provisions
               of this By-law.

(d)  Each applicant for a permit or renewal of a permit
     shall prepare a single application form upon which all
     newsracks owned by that person and located on a public
     way or sidewalk in the town shall be listed.

     Commissioner.  Upon receipt by the Commissioner, the
     amendment application shall constitute an amendment to
     the permit subject, however, to all other applicable

(h)  Within 14 days after receipt of an application for a
     permit or renewal of a permit under this By-law, the
     Commissioner shall either issue or renew the permit or
     deny the application by giving written notice and a

     the requirements set forth in this By-law.

(i)  If the Commissioner has not acted on a permit
     application within 14 days of receipt thereof,
     pursuant to subsection (h), the permit will be deemed

     applicable provisions of this By-law.

(j)  If the Commissioner denies an application, in whole or
     in part, the applicant may appeal the Commissioner's

     public hearing, issue an order affirming, reversing or
     modifying the Commissioner's decision.  If an order has
     not been issued by the Board within 14 days after
     hearing, the Commissioner's decision shall be deemed
     affirmed.

(l)  During the pendency of an appeal, the newsrack(s) may
     remain in place subject to the removal provisions in
     section 7.6.4(b), Parts (3) and (4).

               determined by the Commissioner, in which
               case the newsrack may be installed so as to

     By-law.

(c)  Newsracks may only be attached or secured to
     town-owned property with the  express permission of

```

### SECTION 7.6.4 VIOLATIONS

```
(a)  No person shall place, cause to be placed or maintain
     a newsrack upon any sidewalk or public way in the town
     in violation of the provisions of this By-law.  In the
     event that a newsrack is determined to be in violation
     of any of the provisions of this By-law,

     1. the Commissioner shall provide written and/or
        telephone notice to the owner or the owner's
        agent that the newsrack is in violation of this
        By-law.  Such notice shall state the substance of
        the violation and shall set a date for compliance
        which shall not be less than 10 business days
        after the date notice is given; and

     2. if the Commissioner determines that the violation
        has not been corrected on or after the date for
        compliance, the Commissioner may initiate removal
        proceedings in accordance with the provisions of
        section (b), below, and may assess a fine in
        accordance with provisions of section 7.6.5.

(b)  1. Except as provided in Sections 7.6.4(b), Parts
        (3)and (4), the commissioner may remove and store at
        the owner's expense any newsrack that remains in
        violation for more than 30 days after the date for
        compliance specified in Section 7.6.4(a) provided that
        the Commissioner shall give written notice of removal
        to the owner stating the date the newsrack was
        removed; the reasons for removal; the storage
        location; and the procedure for claiming the machine.

     2. Except as provided in Section 7.6.4(b), Parts (3)
        and (4), the owner of any newsrack may avoid removal
        of the newsrack by:

        (i)  correcting the violation and so informing the
             Commissioner; or

        (ii) by making a written request for a hearing on the
             violation before the Commissioner prior to the
             date set for compliance in which case the
             newsrack may remain in place pending the
             Commissioner's decision on the matter. Said
             hearing shall be held no later than 10 days
             after receipt of a written request for a hearing
             and a decision shall be rendered within 10 days
             thereafter.

     3. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
        By-law, if the Commissioner or a public safety
        official determines that a newsrack constitutes
        an imminent danger of harm to persons or
        property, the Commissioner or a public safety
        official may remove the newsrack provided that
        the owner of the newsrack shall be notified of
        such removal and provided that the newsrack shall
        be stored for a reasonable period of time so that
        the owner can retrieve it.

     4. If maintenance, repair, or construction of a
        public way, sidewalk or public or  private
        property in or adjacent to the public way cannot
        be accomplished without  the removal of a
        newsrack, the Commissioner shall give written
        and/or telephone notice to the newsrack's owner
        ordering removal of the newsrack provided that
        said notice shall specify the reason for the
        removal and the date for compliance which shall
        not be less than 10 days after the date of
        notice. If the Commissioner determines that delay
        would cause an unreasonable risk of harm to
        persons or property or would cause a delay in the
        maintenance, repair or construction work, the
        Commissioner may remove the newsrack, provided
        that the owner of the newsrack shall be notified
        of the removal; that the newsrack shall be stored
        for a reasonable period of time so that the owner
        can retrieve it and further provided that the
        owner may replace the newsrack when said
        maintenance, repair or construction is completed.

     5. The Commissioner, with the approval of the Board
        of Selectmen, is authorized to establish fees for
        the removal and storage of newsracks that are
        removed at the direction of the Commissioner or
        public safety officials in accordance with
        provisions of this By-law provided that said fees
        do not exceed the actual cost of removal and
        storage.

     6. If a newsrack remains unclaimed for more than 60
        days after notice of removal is sent to the owner
        or for more than 60 days after the newsrack is
        removed if the owner is unknown, then possession
        of the newsrack shall be transferred to the
        police department and the newsrack shall be
        disposed of as unclaimed property in accordance
        with law.
```

### SECTION 7.6.5 PENALTY

```
In the event that a newsrack is not in compliance with any
of the provisions of this By-law as of the date set for
compliance under section 7.6.4(a) of this By-law, then
the owner of such newsrack shall be subject to a fine of
$25.00 per day for each day of non-compliance until the
date the violations are corrected or the newsrack
is removed.
```

provision of the By-law is held invalid, invalidity shall
not affect other provisions of this By-law which shall
