     town prior to the effective date of this By-law and
     who wishes to maintain said newsrack on and after said
     date shall, within sixty (60) days after said date,
     apply for a permit from the Commissioner in accordance
     with the provisions of this By-law.

(b) No person, on or after the effective date of this By-
    law, shall place a newsrack or cause a newsrack to be
    placed on a sidewalk or public way in the town without
    a valid permit received from the Commissioner in
    accordance with the provisions of this By-law.  A
    newsrack on a sidewalk or public way without such
    permit affixed to it may be removed immediately by the
    Commissioner.

(c)  The Commissioner shall provide a permit application
     form which shall be completed by every person who
     places or maintains a newsrack on a public way in the
     Town of Brookline.  The form shall require the
     applicant to provide the following information:

          (1)  a description sufficient to show the precise
               address and location of each newsrack and
               whether or not it is attached to town-owned
               property;

          (2)  the name, address, email address  and
               telephone number of the owner of each
               newsrack and the name, address, email
               address and telephone number of a person
               responsible for the maintenance and
               operation of the newsrack who may be
               contacted in an emergency; and

          (3)  a certification that the specified location
               and the newsrack comply with the provisions
               of this By-law.

(d)  Each applicant for a permit or renewal of a permit
     shall prepare a single application form upon which all
     newsracks owned by that person and located on a public
     way or sidewalk in the town shall be listed.

(e)  Permits shall be valid only during the calendar year
     for which they are issued and, upon application, may
     be renewed by the Commissioner on an annual basis.
     Renewal applications must be received by the
     Commissioner with all required fees and payment of any
     outstanding fees and fines prior to December 1st to
     ensure timely renewal for the following calendar year.
     The owner shall ensure that newsracks are in
     compliance with this By-law at the time of permit
     issuance and any renewal.

(f)  Each person granted a permit or renewal thereof under
     this By-law shall thereafter give notice to the
     Commissioner of any change in the location of a
     newsrack or the installation of a newsrack in a
     location not previously listed on a permit by the
     submission of a quarterly amendment application to the
     Commissioner.  Upon receipt by the Commissioner, the
     amendment application shall constitute an amendment to
     the permit subject, however, to all other applicable
     provisions of this By-law.  The Commissioner shall
     specify on the permit the dates for receipt of such
     quarterly amendment applications provided that they
     occur at intervals of not less than ninety (90) days
     commencing on the date the permit was issued.

(g)  The Board of Selectmen is authorized to establish
     reasonable fees for original  permit applications,
     annual renewal applications and amendment applications
     provided that such fees do not exceed the actual cost
     of administering this By-law.  Newsracks owned by the
     Town of Brookline shall be exempt from fees.  No permit
     shall be issued, renewed or amended without payment of
     the required fees and any outstanding fees and fines.
     No permit shall be affixed to any newsrack that is not
     in compliance with this By-law.

(h)  Within 14 days after receipt of an application for a
     permit or renewal of a permit under this By-law, the
     Commissioner shall either issue or renew the permit or
     deny the application by giving written notice and a
     statement of reasons to the applicant.  A denial shall
     be based upon the failure of the applicant to satisfy
     the requirements set forth in this By-law.

(i)  If the Commissioner has not acted on a permit
     application within 14 days of receipt thereof,
     pursuant to subsection (h), the permit will be deemed
     issued or renewed subject, however, to all other
     applicable provisions of this By-law.

(j)  If the Commissioner denies an application, in whole or
     in part, the applicant may appeal the Commissioner's
     decision to the Board of Selectmen by giving written
     notice to the Board within 10 days after receipt of
     notice of the Commissioner's  decision.

(k)  The Board of Selectmen shall hold a public hearing on
     the appeal no later than 30 days after receipt of said
     notice by the Board and shall, within 14 days after a
     public hearing, issue an order affirming, reversing or
     modifying the Commissioner's decision.  If an order has
     not been issued by the Board within 14 days after
     hearing, the Commissioner's decision shall be deemed
     affirmed.

               travelers unless the width of the sidewalk
               is otherwise reduced to less than 4 feet, as
               determined by the Commissioner, in which
               case the newsrack may be installed so as to
               avoid further reducing the width of the
               sidewalk;

               designated bus stops and MBTA railroad
               platforms, crossings and parking lots.  This
               restriction shall not apply to parcels zoned
               for a mixed residential and business use.

          (17) in a manner that violates any provision of

(b)  Newsracks may be secured to one another provided that
     they are no more than six inches apart and provided
     that the newsracks are aligned in a row that is
     parallel to the nearest curb line.  Individual
     newsracks shall be installed parallel to the nearest
     curb line.  Newsracks may be clustered back-to-back to
     form two rows provided that the rows are parallel to
     the nearest curb line, that the town permit is visible
     from the public way and that the newsracks otherwise
     comply with the provisions of this By-law.

(c)  Newsracks may only be attached or secured to
     town-owned property with the  express permission of
     the Commissioner and then, only if the newsrack is
     otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this
     By-law.

(d)  Newsracks shall not exceed the following dimensional
     requirements: Height: 4 1/2 feet from the ground;

     shall be removed if their use is discontinued and
     shall be maintained in good repair and clean and safe
     condition such that each newsrack:

     1. is regularly serviced;

     2. is kept free of accumulations of outdated printed
        materials, trash, rubbish or debris;

     3. is kept free of stickers (other than the town

        peeling, or cracked paint and of rust or
        corrosion;

        parts, if any, through which the printed material
        being dispensed is visible are not broken and are
        kept free of stickers, graffiti, tears, peeling
        and/or fading;

     6. is maintained so that its structural parts are
        not broken or misshapen.

(e)  No newsrack shall bear any advertising other than that
     directly relating to the printed matter dispensed by
     the newsrack.  A newsrack may dispense more than   one
     publication (printed matter) if it is published by the
     owner of the newsrack or an affiliate thereof and the
     newsrack may bear advertising directly related to each
     publication dispensed by the newsrack.

### SECTION 7.6.4 VIOLATIONS

```
(a)  No person shall place, cause to be placed or maintain
     a newsrack upon any sidewalk or public way in the town
     in violation of the provisions of this By-law.  In the
     event that a newsrack is determined to be in violation
     of any of the provisions of this By-law,

     1. the Commissioner shall provide written, email
        and/or telephone notice to the owner or the
        owner's agent that the newsrack is in violation
        of this By-law.  Such notice shall state the
        substance of the violation and, except as
        provided in Sections 7.6.4(b), Parts (3) and (4),
        which provide for immediate or expedited removal,
        shall set a date for compliance which shall not
        be less than 14 days after the date notice is
        given; and

     2. if the Commissioner determines that the violation
        has not been corrected on or after the date for
        compliance, the Commissioner may initiate removal
        proceedings in accordance with the provisions of
        section (b), below, and may assess a fine in
        accordance with provisions of section 7.6.5.

(b)  1. Except as provided in Sections 7.6.4(b), Parts
        (3)and (4), the commissioner may remove and store
        at the owner's expense any newsrack that remains
        in violation after the date for compliance
        specified in Section 7.6.4(a)(1) provided that
        the Commissioner shall give email or written
        notice of removal to the owner stating the date
        the newsrack was removed; the reasons for
        removal; the storage location; and the procedure
        for claiming the newsrack.

     2. Except as provided in Section 7.6.4(b), Parts (3)
        and (4), the owner of any newsrack may avoid removal
        of the newsrack by:

        (i)  correcting the violation and so informing the
             Commissioner; or

        (ii) by making a written request for a hearing on the
             violation before the Commissioner prior to the
             date set for compliance in which case the
             newsrack may remain in place pending the
             Commissioner's decision on the matter. Said
             hearing shall be held no later than 10 days
             after receipt of a written request for a hearing
             and a decision shall be rendered within 10 days
             thereafter. A request for hearing shall not
             preclude the assessment of a fine in accordance
             with the provisions of Section 7.6.5, unless the
             Commissioner finds that the newsrack was in fact
             not in violation of this By-Law on the date set
             for compliance.

     3. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
        By-law, if the Commissioner or a public safety
        official determines (a) that a newsrack has been
        placed or maintained on a sidewalk or public way
        without a valid permit affixed to it, or that a
        newsrack is not in compliance with this By-law at
        the  time that an initial or renewal permit would
        be affixed to  such newsrack, or (b)that a
        newsrack constitutes an imminent danger of harm
        to persons or property, the Commissioner or a
        public safety official may remove the newsrack
        provided that the owner of the newsrack shall be
        notified of such removal and provided that the
        newsrack shall be stored for a reasonable period
        of time so that the owner can retrieve it.

     4. If maintenance, repair, or construction of a
        public way, sidewalk or public or  private
        property in or adjacent to the public way cannot
        be accomplished without  the removal of a
        newsrack, the Commissioner shall give written,
        email and/or telephone notice to the newsrack's
        owner ordering removal of the newsrack provided
        that said notice shall specify the reason for the
        removal and the date for compliance which shall
        not be less than 10 days after the date of
        notice. If the Commissioner determines that delay
        would cause an unreasonable risk of harm to
        persons or property or would cause a delay in the
        maintenance, repair or construction work, the
        Commissioner may remove the newsrack, provided
        that the owner of the newsrack shall be notified
        of the removal; that the newsrack shall be stored
        for a reasonable period of time so that the owner
        can retrieve it and further provided that the
        owner may replace the newsrack when said
        maintenance, repair or construction is completed.

     5. The Commissioner, with the approval of the Board
        of Selectmen, is authorized to establish fees for
        the removal and storage of newsracks that are
        removed at the direction of the Commissioner or
        public safety officials in accordance with
        provisions of this By-law provided that said fees
        do not exceed the actual cost of removal and
        storage.

     6. If a newsrack remains unclaimed for more than 60
        days after notice of removal is sent to the owner
        or for more than 60 days after the newsrack is
        removed if the owner is unknown, then possession
        of the newsrack shall be transferred to the
        police department and the newsrack shall be
        disposed of as unclaimed property in accordance
        with law.
```

### SECTION 7.6.5 PENALTY

```
In the event that a newsrack is not in compliance with any
of the provisions of this By-law as of the date set for
compliance under section 7.6.4(1) of this By-law, then
the owner of such newsrack shall be subject to a fine of
$25.00 per day for each day of non-compliance until the
date the violations are corrected or the newsrack
is removed.
```

### SECTION 7.6.6 SEVERABILITY

```
The provisions of this By-law are severable.  If any
provision of the By-law is held invalid, invalidity shall
not affect other provisions of this By-law which shall
remain valid.
```
