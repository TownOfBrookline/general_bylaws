## ARTICLE 7.9<br/>SNOW PARKING BAN

```
No person shall allow any vehicle to remain in or within a
street or way when a snow emergency parking ban has been
declared by the Chairman of the Board of Selectmen, or in
the absence of the Chairman, by a Selectman.

A Snow Emergency Parking Ban may be declared by the
Chairman of the Board of Selectmen, or in the absence of
the Chairman, by a Selectman, whenever there are
indications that the threat of substantial snow is
imminent, whenever there has been a substantial snow and
snow removal operations are underway or are about to
commence, or whenever a substantial snow creates conditions
that require a vehicular driving or parking ban throughout
the town.  Upon the declaration of a Snow Emergency Parking
Ban notice thereof shall be given to the Town Clerk's
office, the Police Department, the Fire Department and the
Department of Public Works.  Reasonable action shall also
be taken to notify and warn the inhabitants of the town of
the ban.
