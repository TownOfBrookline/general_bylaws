Permits for the public consumption of alcoholic beverages;

(a)  Any person(s) seeking a permit under Section 4(b)
     shall make an application in writing to the Board of
     Selectmen.  The application shall specify the name and
     address of the applicant(s), the date, hour and
     location, number and ages of persons and nature of the
     function associated with the  proposed use.
(b)  Prior to the issuance of a permit, the Board of
     Selectmen shall request and receive the approval or
     denial of any other municipal board, agency or
     department which has jurisdiction.  Any permit or
     consent given under Paragraphs (a) through (d) may be
     revoked by the Board of Selectmen without prior
     notice, when, with probable cause in the opinion of
     the Board, a disturbance or other probable nuisance
     may or shall occur.
(c)  In the instance of a group or organization function,
     one permit may be issued to an officer or duly
     appointed representative of said group or organization
     in lieu of individual permits.
(d)  The Board of Selectmen shall not be required to issue
     such permit if, in its opinion, after proper
     investigation, it appears that a public disturbance or
     annoyance may be created thereby, or that the public
     welfare, convenience or necessity will not be
     subserved thereby.
(e)  There shall be a charge imposed for the issuance of
     such permits. Such permits shall be in a form and for
     a fee duly determined by the Board of Selectmen.
(f)  A permit issued in accordance with the terms of this
     Section shall be valid only for the date, time, place
     and individuals or groups set forth in the approved
     application. Anyone found guilty of violation of this
     By-law shall be punished by a fine of not more than
     fifty dollars ($50.00) for each such violation.
