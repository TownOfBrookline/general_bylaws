## ARTICLE 3.22<br/>THE PUBLIC’S RIGHT TO BE HEARD ON WARRANT ARTICLES

```
Any committee as defined in section 1.1.4, before taking its
first or only vote with respect to an Article on the Warrant,
must hold a duly noticed public hearing with respect to the
Article, and the committee’s permanent record must record that a
duly noticed public hearing with respect to such Article
occurred before such vote.

Due notice of the public hearing shall be satisfied if the due
notice complies with the Open Meeting Law (G.L. C. 30A, secs. 18
et seq.) and By-law 3.21.3(a).

The vote may take place at any time or date after the completion
of the duly noticed public hearing.

This Article shall not apply to the plenum of the Advisory
Committee or School Committee, provided a subcommittee of those
bodies assigned to review and report to the full Committee on a
warrant article complies with the by-law by holding a duly
noticed public hearing before any vote on said warrant article.
