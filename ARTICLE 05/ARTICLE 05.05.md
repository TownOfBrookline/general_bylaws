### SECTION 5.5.7 FUNCTIONS, POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION

```
(a)  Whenever the Commission receives a complaint that is

     Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination
     hereinafter "MCAD", the Commission shall inform the
     complainant of his/her right to file a complaint at
     the MCAD with the Commission's assistance.  At the
     complaint's discretion, the Commission shall either:
     1.   take the action required by the provisions of
          subsection (b) below; and
     2.   prepare an MCAD complaint in the form and manner
          prescribed by MCAD and have such complaint signed
          under oath by the complainant and transmit such
          MCAD complaint to MCAD for filing without delay.

(b)  Whenever the Commission receives a complaint that is
     not within the jurisdiction of MCAD, or is referred to
     the Commission by the MCAD, or over which the
     Commission retains jurisdiction under Section A above,
     the Commission shall:
     1.   prepare a complaint in the form and manner
          prescribed by the Commission;
     2.   investigate such complaint.  In connection with

          or any committee thereof, a witness shall have
          the right to be advised and represented by
          counsel.  However, unavailability of counsel is
          not an adequate basis for requiring a delay of
          any hearing or proceeding;
     3.   attempt by mediation to resolve such complaint
          and recommend to all appropriate governmental
          agencies, federal, state or local, such action as
          it feels will resolve such complaint;
     4.   after completion of the investigation of any such
          complaint not resolved by mediation, make a
          written report of its findings and
          recommendations (including, where appropriate,
          the seeking of equitable relief, or fines, or
          money damages) to the Board of Selectmen and to
          any governmental agency having jurisdiction of
          the matter in question and, in all cases, urge
          and use its best efforts to bring about
          compliance with its recommendations.
(c)  In addition to the aforementioned complaint-processing
     responsibilities, the Commission shall have the
     following additional functions, powers and duties:
     1.   to make studies and survey and to issue such
          publications and such results of investigations
          and research as, in its judgment, will tend to
          promote good will and minimize or eliminate
          discrimination in housing because of race, color,
          creed, religion, sex, handicap, children, marital
          status, sexual orientation, source of income
          including rental housing assistance, military
          status, age, ancestry and/or national origin.

          the need for mutual respect and the achievement
          of harmonious relations among various groups in
          the Town of Brookline.

          the commission as, in the commission's judgment,
          will best aid in effectuating the policy of this
          by-law;
     5.   to enter into cooperative working agreements with
          federal, state and city agencies, and to enlist
          the cooperation of the various racial, religious
          and ethnic groups, civic and community
