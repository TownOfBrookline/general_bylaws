## ARTICLE 5.10<br/>NEIGHBORHOOD CONSERVATION DISTRICTS

### 5.10.1. TITLE AND PURPOSE

```
This by-law shall be known as and may be titled the
Brookline Neighborhood Conservation District By-law. The
Town of Brookline hereby establishes the category of
Neighborhood Conservation District (“NCD”).

This by-law is enacted for the purposes of preserving and
protecting groups of buildings and their settings that are
architecturally or historically significant; preserving and
protecting the layout of neighborhoods or historical
subdivisions of neighborhoods, vehicular and pedestrian
circulation patterns, green spaces, open spaces,
landscapes, and viewsheds that are historically significant
or significant to the character of the town or its
neighborhoods; preserving and protecting distinctive
features of the architectural, environmental, cultural,
economic, political or social history of the town and its
neighborhoods, and limiting the detrimental effect of
alterations, additions, demolitions and new construction on
the character of the town and its neighborhoods.  Through
this by-law, alterations, additions, demolition and new
construction may be reviewed for compatibility, including
without limitation design, massing, topography, scale and
materials, with the existing buildings, green spaces, open
spaces, courtyards, landscapes, neighborhood and
subdivision plans and layouts, circulation patterns,
viewsheds, settings and neighborhood character.  This by-
law seeks to encourage the protection of the natural and
built environment including without limitation buildings,
viewsheds, cultural landscapes, land use patterns and
neighborhood plans through regulatory review.  This by-law
promotes the public welfare by making the town a more
attractive and desirable place in which to live and work by
preserving the distinctive history and character of its
built, landscaped and natural environment.

Each NCD identified in Section 5.10.3 shall be
geographically defined.  Each such district shall be
subject to a set of design guidelines specific to that
district established as set forth herein.

### 5.10.3. DISTRICTS AND GUIDELINES

```
a. A Neighborhood Conservation District shall encompass a
geographically defined area that, at the time of its
establishment, is located in its entirety within one or
more residence districts as defined in section 3.01.1 of
the Zoning Bylaw.  Additional NCDs may be added by majority
vote of Town Meeting and each such NCD and the design
guidelines for such NCD shall be set forth in part d of
this Section 5.10.3, as it may be amended.  The boundaries
of each NCD shall be set forth on a map on file with the
Town Clerk.  The NCD Commission, Town Counsel or Town Clerk
shall, in addition, promptly present a copy of the map and
applicable by-law for filing in the Norfolk County Registry
of Deeds.

b. The design of each Reviewable Project in a Neighborhood
Conservation District shall be subject to the particular
design guidelines set forth in this Section 5.10.3 for such
district.

c. The Commission may impose dimensional requirements that
further the purposes of this by-law, including without
limitation preventing Reviewable Projects inconsistent with
the historic or architectural aspects, scale or massing,
neighborhood or subdivision plan or layout, circulation
patterns, or green space, open space, landscape, vegetation
or viewshed character of the NCD.
```

### 5.10.4. NEIGHBORHOOD CONSERVATION DISTRICT OVERSIGHT

```
a. Each Neighborhood Conservation District shall be overseen
by a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission consisting
of no less than five members, which shall not preclude
overlapping membership in whole or in part between
commissions for various NCDs if appropriate to provide
consistency, continuity, economy or other benefits in NCD
administration Town-wide.  If deemed appropriate by the Board
of Selectmen for the administration of a specific NCD after
consultation with the chair of the Brookline Preservation
Commission, the size of an NCD Commission may be increased to
seven members and the specific membership shall be determined
within the limits set forth below.  In the case of a five-
member NCD Commission, up to three members but no less than
one member shall be representatives of the Brookline
Preservation Commission as described in Section 5.6.4 of the
Town By-laws, and the remaining members (and their
alternates) shall be appointed by the Board of Selectmen.  In
the case of a seven-member NCD Commission, up to four members
but no less than one member shall be representatives of the
Brookline Preservation Commission and the remaining (and
their alternates) shall be appointed by the Board of
Selectmen.  The member or members of an NCD Commission
representing the Preservation Commission may be either
regular or alternate members of the Preservation Commission,
and shall be designated by the chair of the Preservation
Commission to serve on a particular NCD Commission.  The
Selectmen’s appointees shall be residents of the Town and may
be, as appropriate, individuals such as members of other
Boards and Commissions, residents and/or property owners
within the NCD, residents of abutting areas, or residents of
the Town with additional expertise in the issues specific to
a particular NCD, such as architecture, historic landscape
preservation, landscape architecture, agriculture,
horticulture or forestry, urban planning or history.  Such
Selectmen’s appointees (including alternates) shall initially
be appointed to one-, two-, or three-year terms so as to
minimize the number of terms that expire in the same year,
and at the expiration of the initial terms, appointments
shall be for three-years.  Each NCD Commission shall elect a
chair and vice-chair from within its own number, and a clerk
from within or without its own number.  In the absence of an
NCD Commission member representing the Preservation
Commission, the NCD Commission chair may appoint any regular
or alternate Preservation Commission Member to act for that
absent member.  In the absence of an NCD Commission member
appointed by the Selectmen, the NCD Commission chair may
appoint any alternate appointed by the Selectmen to act for
that absent member.  Prior to the appointment by the
Selectmen of the Selectmen-appointed NCD Commission members
or alternates or in the event of the unavailability of such
Selectmen’s appointees, those positions shall be filled on an
interim basis by regular or alternate members of the
Preservation Commission appointed by the chair of the
Preservation Commission, so that an NCD at all times has the
requisite number of five (or seven, if applicable) members.

The Commission for each NCD shall exercise its powers in
administering and regulating the alteration of buildings,
other structures and natural and manmade elements within such
NCD as set forth under the procedures and criteria
established in this by-law.

The Commission for each NCD shall review all Reviewable
Projects in the NCD, including without limitation new
construction, demolition or alterations that affect the
landscape or topography, the exterior architectural features
of buildings and other structures, or the mass and siting of
buildings and other structures.  The authority of the
Commission shall be binding except with regard to the
categories of structural, landscape or architectural features
exempted by Section 5.10.6 or that may be otherwise exempted
by the particular design guidelines for a specific district
set forth in Section 5.10.3 of this by-law.

An NCD Commission, or the Town on behalf of any such
commissions, may receive and accept appropriations, grants
and gifts to further the purposes of this by-law.  An NCD
Commission, or the Town on behalf of any such commissions, is
also authorized to the extent permissible by law to require
the collection of funds as part of an application to be
placed in a separate account. These funds may be used to fund
Town review of a Reviewable Project, including the retention
of consultants or the funding of staff required to complete
review of an application.

b. An NCD Commission, after a public hearing duly noticed at
least 14 days in advance, may adopt, and from time to time
amend, reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with
the provisions of this by-law or other by-laws governing the
Commission.  Such rules and regulations shall set forth such
forms and procedures as it deems desirable and necessary for
the regulation of its affairs and the conduct of its
business, including requirements for the contents and form of
applications for certificates, the process for collecting and
utilizing funds including without limitation application fees
and funds required to fund Town review, hearing procedures
and other matters.  Such rules and regulations may also
include a set of design review standards, not inconsistent
with the applicable design guidelines and exemptions
contained herein under Sections 5.10.3 and 5.10.6, to refine
and clarify the application of the design guidelines during
the design review process.  The NCD Commissions for various
NCDs within the Town may adopt common rules and regulations
for the conduct of their business, consistent with the
specific design guidelines applicable to each NCD, including
coordinating or integrating procedures for review of
applications. The Commission promulgating any such rules and
regulations shall file a copy thereof with the office of the
Town Clerk.
```

### 5.10.5. PROJECTS PROHIBITED WITHOUT A CERTIFICATE

```
Except as this by-law provides, no building, other
structure, site, property or part thereof within a
Neighborhood Conservation District shall be altered (which
term includes complete or partial demolition and new
construction) and no other Reviewable Project may proceed
unless the Commission shall first have issued a Certificate
of Appropriateness.  A building permit (which shall include
permits for demolition) or an occupancy permit may not be
issued for an altered building, structure, site or property
or other Reviewable Project without the prior issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness.
```

### 5.10.6. ALTERATIONS EXEMPT FROM COMMISSION REVIEW

```
a. It shall be the responsibility of the staff of the
Commission, with the concurrence of the Chair of the
Commission, to determine whether a proposed alteration or
other project is exempt from review and they shall have ten
business days to make this determination.  Any alteration
or project that is exempt from review shall receive a
Certificate of Exemption that will permit such alteration
or project to go forward without further review under the
Neighborhood Conservation District By-Law. The Commission
may establish regulations to define projects that are of
insufficient significance to warrant Commission review, and
Commission staff may issue a Certificate of Exemption for
such a project.
.

b. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit review to
features visible from a public way unless such a limitation
is set forth in the particular design guidelines for a
specific district set forth in Section 5.10.3.d of this by-
law.

c. The following projects or portions of Reviewable
Projects are exempt from Commission review in all NCD
districts:

1. Temporary buildings and structures subject to time
   limits (no longer than 6 months) and size limits
   determined by the Neighborhood Conservation District
   Commission.

2. One-story detached accessory structures without
   permanent foundations used as tool and storage
   sheds, playhouses, and similar uses provided the
   floor area does not exceed 100 square feet.  This
   exemption shall not apply to garages, parking
   structures or other structures for vehicular use nor
   to structures to shelter or visually shield HVAC
   equipment.

3. Interior Alterations, including interior demolition
   as defined in Sections 5.3.2(h)(iii) and (iv) (such
   sections shall continue to be applicable to the
   Demolition Delay By-Law).

4. Ordinary maintenance and repair of architectural
   features that match the existing conditions
   including materials, design and dimensions.

5. Removal of substitute siding provided, however, that
   any replacement siding and trim shall be reviewable.

6. Reversible changes of color (such as staining or
   repainting of wood siding or trim, but not work such
   as painting of previously unpainted masonry).

7. Removal, replacement or installation of the
   following exterior elements (this exemption shall
   not apply to replacement windows which may include
   storms or screens):
   a. Exterior storm windows and exterior storm doors
   b. Exterior window screens or exterior screen
      doors
   c. Gutters and downspouts
   d. Removable window air conditioners, but not
      permanently installed HVAC equipment whether as
      part of a building or freestanding.
   e. Satellite dishes or antennae less than 3 feet
      in maximum width.

8. In-kind replacement of plant material.

9. Removal of public shade trees or removal of plant
   material that is severely damaged or dying due to
   weather-related events or natural causes.

10. Reconstruction, substantially similar in exterior
   design, of a building, damaged or destroyed by fire,
   storm or other disaster, provided such
   reconstruction is begun within the time period
   specified in Section 8.03.1 of the Zoning By-Law and
   carried forward with due diligence.

11. Replacement windows and doors, and windows and
   doors installed in an addition or new construction,
   whether including single-pane glass or multiple-pane
   insulating glass, provided that (a) the exterior
   appearance is consistent in size, scale and
   detailing with that of pre-existing windows and
   doors on the building and adjacent buildings, as
   through the use of true divided lites or exterior
   muntins adhered to the exterior glass surface, and
   (b) reflective or tinted glass is not used, unless
   used in the pre-existing windows and doors.
```

### 5.10.7. PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW

```
Any Reviewable Project not exempted above requires the
submittal of an application for regulatory review by the
Commission.  The application shall be accompanied by a
filing fee as may be determined from time to time by the
Board of Selectmen.  As may reasonably be deemed necessary
by the Commission to enable it to make its determination on
the application, the application may be required to include
(a) drawings and/or photographs showing existing
conditions, including existing buildings and other
structures, landscape features and vegetation, open spaces
and pedestrian and vehicular paths, and (b) plans,
elevations, specifications, photographs, descriptions of
materials and other supporting information of the proposed
changes.

Within forty-five business days of the submittal of a
complete application, including all required supporting
information, the Commission shall hold a public hearing on
the application.  At least fourteen days before said public
hearing, public notice shall be given.  Such notice shall
identify the time, place and purpose of the public hearing.

At or subsequent to the public hearing, the Commission
shall determine whether the proposed alteration or other
Reviewable Project, including any modification thereof
agreeable to the applicant, is compatible with the specific
design guidelines of the applicable district and the
purposes of this by-law.  The Commission may waive or
modify the application of a design guideline in a
particular case if such waiver will not derogate the
protections provided by this by-law to the neighborhood and
abutters.

If the Commission determines that the alteration is
compatible with the design guidelines for the district, the
Commission shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness.
If deemed necessary to ensure that an alteration is
compatible with the design guidelines, the Commission may
attach appropriate conditions to the Certificate of
Appropriateness.  The concurring vote of a majority of
Commission members, including voting alternates (i.e., not
less than three votes for a five-member commission and not
less than four votes for a seven-member commission) shall
be required to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness.

If the Commission does not determine that the alteration is
compatible with the design guidelines for the district, the
Commission shall deny the Certificate of Appropriateness.
The Commission shall provide the applicant with the
reasoning for its denial including the manner in which the
alteration does not meet the applicable design guidelines
in Section 5.10.3.d or the purposes of this by-law.

The Commission may further delay or totally prohibit
demolition in addition to any delay provided by the
Brookline Demolition Delay By-Law.  In considering an
application to demolish a building or structure, the
Commission shall consider the architectural or historical
significance of the building, including, if any, the
findings of the Preservation Commission under the
Demolition Delay By-Law; the siting and significance of the
building or structure in relation to its surroundings and
surrounding buildings either by itself or as a component as
a group of buildings or structures; and the design and
siting of any replacement building or structure.
```

### 5.10.8. PROCEDURES FOR ISSUANCE AND FILING OF CERTIFICATES

```
Each Certificate issued by the Commission shall be dated
and signed by its chairperson or such other person
designated by the Commission to sign such Certificates on
its behalf.  The Commission shall send a copy of its
Certificate or denial to the applicant and shall file a
copy of the Certificate or denial with the office of the
Town Clerk and the Building Commissioner.  The date of
issuance of a Certificate or denial shall be the date of
the filing of a copy of such Certificate or denial with the
office of the Town Clerk.

If the Commission should fail to make a determination
within sixty business days of the filing of a complete
application for a Certificate including all required
supporting information, or within such further time as the
applicant may allow in writing, the Commission shall
thereupon issue a Certificate of Appropriateness due to
failure to act.
```

### 5.10.9. ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES

```
The Commission is specifically authorized to institute any
and all actions, including proceedings in law and in
equity, as it deems necessary and appropriate to obtain
compliance with the requirements of this by-law or to
prevent a threatened violation thereof.

The Commission may designate the Building Commissioner to
act on its behalf and to enforce this by-law under the
direction of the Commission.

Any owner of a property subject to this by-law that has
altered a building or other structure or proceeded with a
Reviewable Project without first obtaining a Certificate of
Appropriateness in accordance with the provisions of this
by-law shall be subject to a fine of not more than Three
Hundred Dollars.  Each day the violation exists shall
constitute a separate offense until the alteration is
corrected, the addition is removed, a faithful restoration
of the demolished building or structure is completed,
suitable replacement trees are planted, or the property is
otherwise returned to its original condition unless
otherwise agreed to by the Commission.
```

### 5.10.10. APPEAL PROCEDURE

```
Any applicant or person aggrieved by a determination of the
Commission may appeal as provided for in the Massachusetts
General Laws.
```

### 5.10.11. VALIDITY AND SEEVERABILITY; OTHER BY-LAWS

```
The provisions of this by-law shall be deemed to be
severable.  If any of its provisions, sections,
subsections, sentences or clauses shall be held to be
invalid or unconstitutional, the remainder of this by-law
shall continue to be in full force and effect.  Nothing in
this by-law shall be construed as repealing or modifying
any existing by-law or regulation of the Town, but it shall
be in addition thereto.  To the extent this by-law imposes
greater restrictions upon a Reviewable Project than other
by-laws, regulations or statutes, such greater restrictions
shall prevail.
```
