## ARTICLE 5.3<br/>DEMOLITION BY-LAW

### SECTION 5.3.1 INTENT AND PURPOSE

```
This by-law is adopted to preserve and protect significant
buildings within the Town which reflect distinctive
features of the architectural, cultural, political,
economic or social history of the Town and/or Commonwealth;
to encourage property owners of significant buildings to
seek ways to preserve, rehabilitate or restore such
buildings rather than demolish them; and by furthering
these purposes, to preserve the resources of the Town and
promote the public welfare.  To achieve these purposes, the
Brookline Preservation Commission is empowered to direct
the Building Commissioner with respect to the issuance of
demolition permits as provided in this by-law.
