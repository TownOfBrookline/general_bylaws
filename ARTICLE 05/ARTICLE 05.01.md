phrases, words and their derivations shall have the
meanings given herein.  When not inconsistent with the
context, words used in the present tense include the
future; words used in the plural number include the
singular number; and words in the singular number include
the plural number.  The word "shall" is always mandatory
and not merely directory.

     (a)  The term "Alarm System" means an assembly of
          equipment and devices or a single device such as
          a solid state unit which plugs directly into a
          110 volt AC line, arranged to signal the presence
          of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to
          which police are expected to respond.  Fire alarm
          systems and alarm systems which monitor
          temperature, smoke, humidity or any other
          condition not directly related to the detection
          of an unauthorized intrusion into a premises or

          such a system, however, employs an audible signal
          emitting sounds or a flashing light or beacon
          designed to signal persons outside the premises,
          such system shall be within the definition of
          "alarm system", as that term is used in this by-
          law, and shall be subject to this by-law.

          particular location, or which indicates line
          trouble.

     (g)  The term "Direct Connect" means an alarm system
          which has the capability of transmitting system
          signals to and receiving them at the Brookline

     (h)  The term "False Alarm" means 1) the activation of
          an alarm system through mechanical failure,

     Such services shall be set forth in the form of a
     written contract between the alarm company and each
     alarm user.  The provisions of this paragraph (B)
     relate solely to the aforementioned communications
     console, connections to the said console by alarm
     users, and fees and charges related to the
     installation and maintenance of the console.  Any
     alarm user may contract with any alarm company of his
     choice for the sale, installation, maintenance, and/or
     servicing of the alarm system to be installed on his

### SECTION 5.1.6 CONTROL AND CURTAILMENT OF SIGNALS EMITTED BY ALARM SYSTEMS

```
(a)  Every alarm user shall submit to the Police Chief and
     the alarm company who maintains the system at the
     police communications console the names and telephone
     numbers of at least two other persons who can be
     reached at any time, day or night, and who are
     authorized to respond to an emergency signal
     transmitted by an alarm system, and who can open the
     premises wherein the alarm system is installed.  The
     names, addresses and telephone numbers of the
     responders must be kept current at all times by the
     alarm user and the alarm company.

(b)  All alarm systems directly connected to the Police
     station shall be equipped with a test device which
     will give a ten-second delay or longer prior to alarm
     system activation in order to warn the alarm user of
     an open alarm circuit.

(c)  Any alarm system emitting a continuous and
     uninterrupted signal for more than fifteen (15)
     minutes which cannot be shut off or otherwise
     curtailed due to the absence or unavailability of the
     alarm user or those persons designated by him under
     paragraph (a) of this section, and which disturbs the
     peace, comfort or repose of a community, or a
     neighborhood of the area where the alarm system is
     located, shall constitute a public nuisance.  Upon
     receiving complaints regarding such a continuous and
     uninterrupted signal, the Police Chief shall endeavor
     to contact the alarm user under paragraph (a) of this
     section in an effort to abate the  nuisance.  The
     Police Chief shall cause to record the names and
     addresses of all complainants and the time each
     complaint was received.

     In the event that the Police Chief is unable to
     contact the alarm user, or member of the alarm user's
     family, or those persons designated by the alarm user
     under paragraph (a) of this section, or if the
     aforesaid persons cannot or will not curtail the
     audible signal being emitted by the alarm system, and
     if the Police Chief is otherwise unable to abate the
     nuisance, he may direct a police officer or a
     firefighter or a qualified alarm technician to enter
     upon the property outside the home or building in
     which the alarm system is located and take any
     reasonable action necessary to abate the nuisance.

     If entry upon property outside the home or building in
     which the alarm system is located is made in
     accordance with this section, the person so entering
     upon such property 1) shall not conduct, engage in, or
     undertake any search, seizure, inspection or
     investigation while he is upon the property; 2) shall
     not cause any unnecessary damage to the alarm system
     or to any part of the home or building; and 3) shall
     leave the property immediately after the audible
     signal has ceased.  After an entry upon property has
     been made in accordance with this section, the Police
     Chief shall have the property secured, if necessary.
     The reasonable costs and expenses of abating a
     nuisance in accordance with this section may be
     assessed to the alarm user, said assessment not to
     exceed $50.00.

     Within ten (10) days after abatement of a nuisance in
     accordance with this section  the alarm user may
     request a hearing before the Selectmen and may present
     evidence showing that the signal emitted by this alarm
     system was not a public  nuisance at the time of the
     abatement; that unnecessary damage was caused to his
     property in the course of the abatement; that the
     costs of the abatement should not  be assessed to him;
     or the requirements of this section were not
     fulfilled.  The Selectmen shall hear all interested
     parties and may, in its discretion, reimburse the
     alarm user for the repairs to this property
     necessitated by the abatement, or excuse the alarm
     user from paying the costs of abatement.

(d)  Effective July 1, 1992, all alarm systems shall be
     equipped with a built-in, recycle, cut-off, timer.
     This timer shall be adjusted so that any audible
     emissions, flashing lights, or beacons designed to
     signal to persons outside the premises shall cease
     such alarm function after fifteen (15) minutes of
     operation.
```

### SECTION 5.1.7 TESTING OF EQUIPMENT

```
No alarm system designed to transmit emergency messages
directly to the police department shall be worked on,
tested or demonstrated without obtaining permission from
the Police Chief.  Permission is not required to test or
demonstrate alarm devices not transmitting emergency
messages directly to the police department.  An
unauthorized test constitutes a false alarm.
```

### SECTION 5.1.8 EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION LIST

```
Every business establishment within the Town whether
alarmed or not shall provide written notice to the Police
Chief listing the names, addresses, and telephone numbers
of at least two persons who may be reached at any time, day
or night and who are authorized to respond to any emergency
which has caused the police to be dispatched to said
premises.  Such notice shall be kept current at all times
reflecting any changes in authorized personnel.  Owner-
residents shall be excluded from this paragraph.
```

### SECTION 5.1.9 FALSE ALARMS

```
     (a)  When emergency messages are received by the
          police department that evidence false alarms, the

          (e) of this section, and, when so required by the
          terms of the aforementioned paragraphs, order
          that use of an alarm system be discontinued.

     (b)  After the police department has recorded three
          (3) separate false alarms within the calendar
          year from an alarm system, the Police Chief shall
          notify the alarm user, in person, by telephone,
          or by mail of such fact and require the said user
          to submit, within fifteen (15) days after receipt
          of such notice, a report describing efforts to
          discover and eliminate the cause or causes of the
          false alarms.  If the said user, on the basis of
          absence from the town, or on any other reasonable
          basis, requests an extension of time for filing
          the report, the Police Chief may extend the
          fifteen (15) day period for a reasonable period.
          If the said user fails to submit such a report
          within fifteen (15) days or within any such
          extended period, the Police Chief shall order the
          use of the alarm system be discontinued.  Any
          such discontinuance shall be effectuated within
          fifteen (15) days from the date of  receipt of
          the Police Chief's order.

     (c)  In the event that the Police Chief determines
          that a report submitted in accordance with
          paragraph (B) of this section is unsatisfactory,
          or that the alarm user has failed to show by the
          report that he has taken or will take reasonable
          steps to eliminate or reduce false alarms, then
          the Police Chief shall order that use of the
          alarm system be discontinued.  Any such
          discontinuance shall be effectuated within
          fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the
          Police Chief's order.

     (d)  In the event that the police department records
          five (5) false alarms within the calendar year
          from an alarm system, the Police Chief may order
          that the user of the alarm system discontinue use
          of the alarm system for the calendar year, but
          for not less than six (6) months from the date
          the alarm was disconnected.  In the event that

          alarm system discontinue use of the alarm system
          for the calendar year, but for not less than six
          (6) months from the date the alarm was
          disconnected.

     (e)  Any user of an alarm system which transmits false
          alarms shall be assessed a penalty of one hundred
          ($100.00) dollars for each false alarm in excess
          of three (3) occurring within the calendar year.
          All fines assessed hereunder shall be paid to the
          Town Treasurer for deposit in the general fund.
          Upon failure of the user of an alarm system to
          pay two (2) consecutive fines assessed hereunder
          within sixty (60) days of assessment, the Police
          Chief shall order that the user discontinue use
          of the alarm system.  Any such discontinuance
          shall be effectuated within fifteen (15) days
          from the date of receipt of the Police Chief's
          order.

     (f)  Any user of an alarm system who has, in
          accordance with this section, been ordered by the
          Police Chief to discontinue use of an alarm
          system may appeal the order of discontinuance to
          the Selectmen.  Notice of an appeal shall be
          filed with the Town Clerk within ten (10) days of
          the date of the order of discontinuance.
          Thereafter the Selectmen shall consider the
          merits of the appeal, and in connection therewith
          shall hear evidence presented by all interested
