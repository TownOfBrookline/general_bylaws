### SECTION 9.1.2 REGISTRATION

```
(a)  Statement of Domestic Partnership

	  1.   Domestic partners who meet the requirements
	       set forth in Section 9.1.1(a) of this by-law
	       may make an official record of their
	       domestic partnership by completing, signing
	       and submitting to the Town Clerk a statement
	       of domestic partnership.  Persons submitting
	       a statement of domestic partnership must
	       declare under penalty of perjury that they
	       meet the requirements set forth in Section
	       9.1.1(a) of this by-law.

	  2.   The domestic partnership statement shall be
	       on a form prescribed by the Town Clerk,
	       which form shall include, but shall not be
	       limited to, the names of the domestic
	       partners and the date on which they became
	       each other's domestic partners.

	  3.   There is no requirement for registering
	       dependents.

(b)  Amendment or Termination of a Domestic
     Partnership

     Domestic partners shall notify the Town Clerk of
     the termination of their domestic partnership.
     Either member of a domestic partnership may
     terminate the domestic partnership by filing a
     termination statement with the Town Clerk.
     Termination of a domestic partnership shall
     become effective ninety days (90) days after the
     termination statement is filed with the Town
     Clerk; provided, however, that a domestic
     partnership shall terminate immediately upon the
     death of one of the partners. Any person filing a
     termination statement must declare under the
     pains and penalties of perjury that the domestic
     partnership is thereby terminated and that the
     other domestic partner has been notified of such
     termination either personally or by mailing a
     copy of the termination statement to the other
     domestic partner's last and usual address by
     certified mail.

(c)  New Statements of Domestic Partnership

     No person may file a statement of domestic
     partnership until any previous domestic
     partnership of which he or she was a member has
     been effectively terminated.

### SECTION 9.1.3 TOWN CLERK

     (a)  Records

          The Town Clerk shall maintain records of the

          domestic partnerships as permanent records. The
          Town Clerk shall provide appropriate forms for a
          Statement of Domestic Partnership, for the
          registration of the Statement and for the
          amendment and termination of a domestic
          partnership.

      (b) Fees for Statements

          The Town Clerk shall charge a fee for filing a
          domestic partnership equal to the fee charged to
          file a marriage license. Payment of the filing
          fee shall entitle the person filing the statement
          on behalf of the domestic partnership to receive
          one copy of the statement certified by the Town
          Clerk. The fee for additional certified copies of
          the statement, or for copies of amendment or

          charged for additional certified copies of a
          marriage license.
