As further detailed in the Town’s policy applicable to Town
licensing-related criminal record background checks, the Police
Department shall provide the applicant with a copy of the
results of his or her fingerprint-based criminal record
background check and supply the applicant the opportunity to
complete, or challenge the accuracy of, the information
contained in it, including in the FBI identification record.
The Police Department shall also supply applicants with

its evaluation of the applicant’s suitability for the proposed

known to it.  In rendering its evaluation, the Police Department

### SECTION 8.30.4 RELIANCE ON RESULTS OF FINGERPRINT-BASED CRIMINAL RECORD BACKGROUND CHECKS

checks in connection with the license applications specified in
Section 8.30.2.  A Town licensing authority may deny an
application for a license on the basis of the results of a
fingerprint-based criminal record background check if it
determines that the results of the check render the subject
unsuitable for the proposed occupational activity.  The
licensing authority shall consider all applicable laws,
regulations and Town policies bearing on an applicant’s
suitability in making this determination.  The licensing
authority shall not deny a license based on information in a
criminal record unless the applicant has been afforded a
reasonable time to correct or complete the record or has
declined to do so.

provided by law, regulation, and Town policy.  The Town shall
not disseminate criminal record information received from the
FBI to unauthorized persons or entities.
