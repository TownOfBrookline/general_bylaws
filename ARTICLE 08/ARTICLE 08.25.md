## ARTICLE 8.25<br/>WATER SYSTEM BACKFLOW AND CROSS CONNECTIONS

### SECTION 8.25.1 AUTHORITY

```
Under Public Law 93-523, the Safe Drinking Water Act of
1974, and Massachusetts Reg. 310 CMR, Section 22.22 of the
Drinking Water Supply Regulations, the water purveyor has
the primary responsibility for preventing water from
unapproved sources, or any other substances, from entering
the public potable water system.
```

### SECTION 8.25.2 PURPOSE

```
The purpose of this By-Law is:

     (a)  To protect the public potable water supply served
          by the Brookline Water Division from the
          possibility of contamination or pollution by
          isolating within its customer's internal
          distribution system(s) such contaminants or
          pollutants which could backflow or backsiphon
          into the public water supply system.

     (b)  To promote the elimination or control of existing
          cross connections, actual or potential, between
          its customer's inplant potable water system(s)
          and non-potable systems.

     (c)  To provide for the maintenance of a continuing
          program of cross connection control which will
          systematically and effectively prevent the
          contamination or pollution of all potable water
          systems by cross connection.
```

### SECTION 8.25.3 RESPONSIBILITY

```
The Water Division shall be responsible for the protection
of the public potable water distribution system from
contamination or pollution due to the backflow or
backsiphonage of contaminants or pollutants.  If, as a
result of a survey of the premises, the Division determines
that an approval back-flow prevention device is required,
at the Town's water service connection to any customer's
premises, for the safety of the water system, the Division
or its designated agent shall give notice in writing to
said customer to install such an approved back-flow
prevention device at each service connection to his
premises.  The customer shall, within 60 days, install such
approved device or devices at his own expense, and failure,
refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install
said device or devices, within 60 days, shall constitute a
ground for disconnecting water service to the premises
until such device or devices have been properly installed.
```

### SECTION 8.25.4 DEFINITIONS

```
(a)  Approved - Accepted by the Water Division as meeting
     an applicable specification stated or cited in this
     regulation, or as suitable for this proposed use.

(b)  Backflow -  The flow of water or other liquids,
     mixtures or substances under  pressure into the
     distributing pipes of a potable water supply system

     source.

(c)  Back-Siphonage - The flow of water or other liquids,
     mixtures or substances into the distributing pipes of
     a potable water supply system from any source other
     than its intended source caused by the sudden
     reduction of pressure in the potable water supply
     system.

(d)  Back-Flow Preventer - A device or means designed to
     prevent back-flow or siphonage.

     1.   Air-Gap - The unobstructed vertical distance
          through the free atmosphere between the lowest
          opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water
          to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and
          the flood rim of said vessel.

     2.   Reduced Pressure Principle Device - An assembly
          of two independently operating check valves with
          an automatically operating differential relief
          valve between the two check valves, two shut-off
          valves plus properly located test cocks.

     3.   Double Check Valve Assembly - An assembly of two
          independently operating approved check valves
          with shut-off valves on each side of the check
          valves, plus properly located test cocks.

### SECTION 8.25.5 REQUIREMENTS

```
(a)  WATER DIVISION

1.   On new installations, the Division will provide on-
     site evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to
     determine the type of backflow preventer, if any, that
     will be required, and notify the owner of plan
     approval requirements by the appropriate reviewing
     authority.

2.   For premises existing prior to the start of this
     program, the Division will perform surveys of the
     premises and reviews of as-built plans and issue a
     cross connection violation form to the owner detailing
     any corrective action required, the method of
     achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the
     correction to be made.  The time period allowed shall
     depend upon the degree of hazard involved.

3.   The Division will not allow any cross connection to
     remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow
     preventer for which a permit has been issued and which
     will be regularly tested to insure satisfactory
     operation.

4.   If the Division determines at any time that a serious
     threat to the public health exists, the water service
     will be terminated immediately.

(b) OWNER

1.   The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or
     protection of all cross  connections on his premises.

2.   The Owner shall be responsible for applying for and
     obtaining all necessary approvals and permits for the
     maintenance of cross connections and installation of
     backflow prevention devices, and applying annually for
     the renewal of each permit.

3.   The Owner shall have any device that fails an
     inspection or test repaired by a   licensed plumber.

4.   The Owner shall inform the Division of any proposed or
     modified cross connection and also any existing cross
     connections of which the owner is aware but has not
     been found by the Division.

5.   The Owner shall not install by-pass around any
     backflow preventer unless there is a backflow
     preventer of the same type on the bypass.  Owners who
     cannot shut down operation for testing of the
     device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to
     allow testing to take place.

6.   The Owner shall install backflow preventers in a
     manner approved by the Department and by the Division.

7.   The Owner shall install only reduced pressure backflow
     preventers and double check valve assemblies approved
     by the Department.

8.   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all
     fees for permits, device testings, retestings in the
     case that the device fails to operate correctly, and
     second re-inspections for non-compliance with Division
     or Department requirements.

(c) TESTING

1.   Reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check
     valve assemblies shall be tested and inspected at
     least semi-annually by the Division's certified
     tester, at the expense of the Owner.

2.   Reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check
     valve assemblies must be tested annually by the Owner,
     independent of the semi-annual test by the water
     supplier, and said test must be conducted by a
     certified tester.

3.   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic
     test must be repaired or replaced by a licensed
     plumber.  When repairs are necessary, upon completion
     of the repair, the device will be retested at the
     Owner's expense to insure proper operation.  High
     hazard situations will not be allowed to continue
     unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test
     and cannot be repaired immediately.  In other
     situations, a compliance date of not more than
     fourteen days after the test date will be established.
     The Owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
     tools, or a replacement device.  Parallel installation
     of two devices is an effective means of the Owner
     insuring that uninterrupted water service remains
     during testings or repair of devices and is strongly
     recommended when the owner desires such continuity.
```

### SECTION 8.25.6 ENFORCEMENT

```
(a)  The Division shall not allow a cross connection to
     exist with the public water system unless it is
     considered necessary and all appropriate approvals and
     permits have been issued.

(b)  Failure of the Owner to comply with any applicable
     section of this By-Law will constitute a violation of
     310 CMR 22.22 and will be subject to termination of
     water service by the Town.
