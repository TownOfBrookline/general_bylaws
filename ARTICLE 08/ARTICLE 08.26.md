## ARTICLE 8.26<br/>STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

### SECTION 8.26.1 DISCHARGES TO THE MUNICIPAL DRAIN SYSTEM

```
1. Purpose

The purpose of Section 8.26.1 is to eliminate non-
stormwater discharges to the Town of Brookline’s
Municipal Storm Drain System (storm drain).  Non-
stormwater discharges contain contaminants and supply
additional flows to the Town of Brookline’s Storm
Drain System.  Non-stormwater discharges are major
causes of:

     a.   impairment of water quality and flow in
          lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, wetlands, and
          groundwater;

     b.   contamination of drinking water supplies;

     c.   alteration or destruction of aquatic and
          wildlife habitat; and

     d. flooding.

Regulation of illicit connections and discharges to
the storm drain system is necessary for the protection
of the Town of Brookline’s, natural resources,
municipal facilities, general health, safety, welfare,
and the environment.

The objectives of this section are:
     a.   to prevent pollutants from entering the
          storm drain;

     b.   to prohibit illicit connections and
          unauthorized discharges to the storm drain

     c.   to  remove  all such illicit connections;

     d.   to comply with state and federal statues and
          regulations relating to stormwater
          discharges; and

     e.   to establish the legal authority to ensure
          compliance with the provisions of this
          section through inspection, monitoring, and
          enforcement.

8. Emergency Suspension of Storm Drainage System Access

The DPW may suspend municipal storm drain system
access to any person or property without prior
written notice when such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge of pollutants
that presents imminent risk of harm to public
health, safety, welfare or the environment.  In the
event any person fails to comply with an emergency
suspension order, the Authorized Enforcement Agency
may take all reasonable steps to prevent or minimize
harm to the public, health, safety, welfare or the
environment.

9. Notification of Spills

Any spills or releases that require notification
under local, state or federal law will be the
responsibility of the person responsible for a
facility or operation, or for an emergency
 response for a facility or operation (i.e.,
construction).  In the event of a spill or
release which may result in a discharge of
pollutants or non-stormwater discharge to the
municipal storm drain system, waters of the
United States, and/or waters of the Commonwealth,
the responsible parties, potentially responsible
parties, or any person or persons managing a site
or facility shall take all necessary steps to
ensure containment, and remediate any municipal
storm drains that have been impacted.  However,
if in the opinion of DPW, there is an excessive
amount of pollutants in the stormdrain system,
the DPW can require remediation by the
responsible party regardless of other state or
federal regulations.  If the discharge of
prohibited materials is from a commercial or
industrial facility, the facility owner or
operator of the facility shall take all necessary
steps to ensure containment, clean-up of the
release, retain on-site a written record of the
discharge, and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.

10. Enforcement

The DPW or an authorized agent of the DPW shall
enforce Article 8.26, regulations, orders,
violation notices, and enforcement orders, and
may pursue all civil and criminal remedies for
such violations.

a) Civil Relief – If a person violates the
   provisions of this by-law, regulations, permit,
   notice, or order issued thereunder, the DPW may
   seek injunctive relief in a court of competent
   jurisdiction restraining the person from
   activities which would create further
   violations or compelling the person to perform
   abatement or remediation of the violation.

b) Orders – The DPW or an authorized agent or
   the DPW may issue a written order to enforce
   the provisions of this by-law or the
   regulations thereunder, which may include:

   a) elimination of illicit connections or
      discharges to the MS4;

   b) performance of monitoring, analyses, and
      reporting;

   c) that unlawful discharges, practices, or
      operations shall cease and desist;

   d) and remediation of contamination in
      connection.

   If the enforcing person determines that
   abatement or remediation of contaminations is
   required and is the responsibility of the
   property owner, the order shall set forth a
   deadline by which such abatement or remediation
   must be completed.  Said order shall further
   advise that, should the violator or property
   owner fail to abate or perform remediation
   within the specified deadline, the Town of
   Brookline may, at its option, undertake such
   work, and expenses times three thereof shall be
   charged to the violator.

   Within thirty (30) days after completing all
   measures necessary to abate the violation or
   to perform remediation, the violator and the
   property owner will be notified of the costs
   incurred by the Town of Brookline, including
   administrative costs.  The violator or property
   owner may file a written protest objecting to
   the amount or basis of costs with The DPW
   within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
   notification of the costs incurred.  If the
   amount due is not received by the expiration of
   the time in which to file a protest or within
   thirty (30) days following a decision of the
   DPW affirming or reducing the costs, or from a
   final decision of a court of competent
   jurisdiction, the costs shall become a special
   assessment against the property owner and shall
   constitute a lien on the owners property for
   the amount of said costs. Interest shall begin
   to accrue on any unpaid costs at the statutory
   rate provided in G.L. Ch. 59, section 57 after
   the thirty-first day at which the costs first
   become due.

c) PENALTY – Any person who violates any
   provision of this by-law, regulation, order or
   permit issued thereunder, shall be punished by
   a fine as set forth in Part X “Penalties and
   Enforcement” of the By-laws of the Town of
   Brookline.

d) ENTRY TO PERFORM DUTIES UNDER THIS BY-LAW –
   To the extent permitted by state law, or if
   authorized by the owner or other party in
   control of the property, the DPW, its agents,
   officers, and employees may enter upon
   privately owned property for the purpose of
   performing their duties under Article 8.26 and
   may make or cause to be made such examinations,
   surveys or sampling as the DPW deems reasonably
   necessary

e. APPEALS – The decision or orders of the DPW
   shall be final.  Further relief shall be to a
   court of competent jurisdiction.

f. REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE – The remedies listed
   in Article 8.26 are not exclusive of any other
   remedies available under any applicable
   federal, state or local law.

shall adhere to the standards and specifications
contained in the Massachusetts Erosion and Sediment
Control Guidelines for Urban and Suburban Areas dated
March 1997 or the latest edition thereof.

6. Review and Approval

An Erosion and Sediment Control review is triggered by
a building permit application or other activity that
falls within the jurisdiction described in paragraphs
3 and 4 above.  Applicants are referred by the permit
issuing agency to the Engineering Division of the
Department of Public Works to conduct the Erosion and
Sediment Control review. Activities that fall within
the jurisdiction described in paragraphs 3 and 4 above
that do not require a permit from any Town department
are not exempt from this provision. In this situation,
the applicant must seek Erosion and Sediment Control
review directly from the Department of Public Works.

The Department of Public Works will review each
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan to determine its
conformance with the provisions of this section.

Within 30 calendar days after receiving an
application, the Department of Public Works shall, in
writing:
   a. Approve the plan as submitted.
   b. Approve the plan subject to such reasonable
      conditions as may be necessary to secure
      substantially the objectives of this
      regulation, and issue the permit subject to
      these conditions; or
   c. Disapprove the plan, indicating the
      reason(s) and procedure for submitting a
      revised application and/or submission.

Failure of the Department of Public Works to act on an
original or revised plan within 30 calendar days of
receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed in
accordance with the plans as filed unless such time is
extended by agreement between the applicant and the
Department of Public Works.  Pending preparation and
approval of a revised plan, development activities
shall be allowed to proceed in accordance with
conditions established by the Department of Public
Works.

7. Inspections

The Commissioner of Public Works, or designated agent
shall make inspections as hereinafter required and
either shall approve that portion of the work
completed or shall notify the owner or person
responsible for the implementation of the plan wherein
the work fails to comply with the Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan as approved.  Plans for grading,
stripping, excavating, and filling work bearing the
stamp of approval of the Department of Public Works
shall be maintained at the site during the progress of
the work.  To obtain inspections, the permittee shall
notify the Department of Public Works at least two
working days before the following:

a. Installation of sediment and erosion control measures
   (* Only notification required on minor projects.)
b. Start of construction
c. Completion of site clearing
d. Completion of rough grading
e. Close of the construction season
f. Completion of final landscaping

The person responsible for implementation of the plan
shall make regular inspections of all control measures
in accordance with the inspection schedule outlined on
the approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plan(s).
The purpose of such inspections will be to determine
the overall effectiveness of the control plan and the
need for additional control measures.  All inspections
shall be documented in written form and submitted to
the Department of Public Works at the time interval
specified in the approved permit.

The Commissioner of Public Works or its designated
agent shall enter the property of the applicant as
deemed necessary to make regular inspections to ensure
the validity of the reports filed as noted above.

8. Enforcement

     a.   Suspension of Construction or Site Alteration
          Activity—In the event that the activity at a site
          violates the conditions as stated or shown on the
          approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plan in
          such a manner as to adversely affect the
          environment, public welfare/health and municipal
          facilities, then the Commissioner of Public Works
          may suspend work until the violation are
          corrected.

### SECTION 8.26.3 POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

```
1.   Purpose

The purpose of this section is to establish minimum
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
environment, natural resources, general health,
safety, and welfare of the public residing in
watersheds within the Town’s jurisdiction from the
adverse impacts of stormwater runoff.  Stormwater
management controls are typically permanent features
of a complete project, and as such require maintenance
and management.  This section seeks to meet that
purpose through the following objectives:

    a. to minimize stormwater runoff from any
       development;

    b. to minimize nonpoint source pollution caused by
       stormwater runoff from development;

    c. to provide for groundwater recharge where
       appropriate; and

    d. to ensure controls are in place to respond to
       objectives a and b and are properly operated and
       maintained.

     a.   Any land disturbance activity greater than 2500
          sq. ft. which would result in an increased amount
          of stormwater runoff from the property to
          public/private property or resource areas.
     b.   Any activity which would increase the flow to the
          municipal storm or sanitary sewer systems.
     c.   Any activity which would alter or modify an
          existing drainage system.

Activities which are exempt from the requirements of an
approved Stormwater Management Plan are:

     a.   Emergency repairs to any stormwater structure.
     b.   Maintenance of existing gardens or lawns.
     c.   Construction of utilities, other than drainage,

4. Stormwater Management Plan

A Stormwater Management Plan, which meets the design
requirements of this By-Law, shall be prepared by a
licensed professional engineer and submitted to the
Department of Public Works.  The plan shall include,
but not be limited to, the items listed below and, at
a minimum, be designed to provide sufficient
information to evaluate the environmental
characteristics of the affected areas, the potential
impacts of the proposed development on water
resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of
measures proposed for managing stormwater runoff.  The
applicant shall certify on the drawings that all
clearing, grading, drainage, construction, and
development shall be conducted in strict accordance
with the plan.  The minimum information, in addition
to the Name, address and telephone number of the
owner, civil engineer and person responsible for
implementation of the plan, submitted for support of a
stormwater management plan shall be as follows:

The applicant should review the scope of work of the
proposed project with a representative of the
Department of Public Works to determine the
requirements of the Stormwater Management Plan.

The DPW may waive any section or all of the stormwater
management plan if it determines that the activity
involved has a deminimus impact on the Town’s
stormwater management system.

5. Design Requirements and Performance Standards

   a.   *Performance Standards*—Control of stormwater
        runoff shall meet the performance standards for
        both flood control (volume and peak discharge)
        and nonpoint source pollution reduction as
        defined in the Massachusetts Stormwater
        Management Policy dated March 1997 as amended.
        All assumptions, methodologies and procedures
	used to design BMP’s and stormwater management
        practices shall  accompany the design.  All
        activities, project design, BMP’s, and stormwater
        management practices should aim to minimize
        stormwater runoff, maximize infiltration and
        recharge where appropriate, and minimize
        pollutants in stormwater runoff.

   b.   Major and Minor Projects—Activities will be
        classified as major and minor projects.  Major
        projects are defined as projects which have
        activities result in the land disturbance of one
        (1) acre or more.  All other activities will be
        considered minor projects.  Requirements for
        major and minor projects are as follows:

        1) Major projects must either meet the requirements
           of the stormwater management standards or
           demonstrate that an equivalent level of
           environmental protection is provided in the event
           that one or more of the standards are not met.
        2) Minor projects must meet the stormwater
           management standards, however, at the discretion
           of the DPW, certain aspects of the Stormwater
           Management Plan may be waived.  In general,
           projects which fall into this category will not
           require the submission of an operation and
           maintenance plan.

6. Review and Approval

The Department of Public Works will review the
Stormwater Management Plan to determine its
conformance with the provisions of this section.  For
major projects, the Conservation Commission shall also
review the Stormwater Management Plan.  Within 30 days
after receiving the plan, the Department of Public
Works shall, in writing:

     a.   Approve the plan as submitted.
     b.   Approve the plan subject to such reasonable
          conditions as may be necessary to secure
          substantially the objectives of this regulation
          and approve the plan subject to these conditions.
     c.   Disapprove the plan indicating the reason(s) and
          procedure for submitting a revised plan and/or
          submission.

Failure of the Department of Public Works to act on an
original or revised application within calendar 30
days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to
proceed in accordance with the plan as filed unless
such time is extended by agreement between the
applicant and the Department of Public Works.  Pending
preparation and approval of a revised plan,
development activities shall be allowed to proceed in
accordance with conditions established by the
Department of Public Works.

7. Inspections

The Commissioner of Public Works, or designated agent
shall make inspections as hereinafter required.  To
obtain inspections, the applicant shall notify the
Department of Public Works at least two working days
before the following:

        a.   Start of construction
        b.   Installation of Stormwater controls
        c.   Close of construction season
        d.   Completion of final grading and landscaping

The applicant shall submit an “as-built” plan for the
stormwater controls after the final construction is
completed.  The plan must show the final design
specifications of all stormwater management controls
and must be prepared by a professional engineer.

8. Enforcement

When the Department of Public Works determines that an
activity is not being carried out in accordance with
the requirements of this by-law, a written notice of
non compliance to the applicant shall be issued which,
at a minimum, will contain the following:

        a.   The name and address of the applicant
        b.   The street address or description of the
             building, structure or land upon which the non
             compliance is occurring
        c.   A statement specifying the nature of the non
             compliance
        d.   A description of the remedial measures
             necessary to bring the activity into compliance
             with this by-law and a time schedule for the
             completion

Applicants receiving a notice of non compliance will
be required to halt all construction activities.  This
“stop work order” will be in effect until the
Department of Public Works confirms that the activity
involved in the non compliance has been satisfactorily
addressed.  Occupancy permits, if applicable, will not
be granted until the requirements of this by-law are
complied with.

In the event that damages occur to the environment,
natural resources, municipal facilities, and/or
general health, safety and welfare of the public due
to improper installation, operation or maintenance of
stormwater controls, a fine may be imposed by the Town
in accordance with the appropriate sections of Part X
“Penalties and Enforcement” in the By-Laws of the Town
of Brookline.
