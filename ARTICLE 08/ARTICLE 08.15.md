```

          (d) Fixed Plant Equipment

              No person owning, leasing or controlling the operation
              of any source of noise of the type listed below shall
              willfully, negligently or through failure to provide
              necessary equipment or facilities or to take necessary
              precautions, permit the establishment or continuation
              of a condition of noise pollution.
              The following sources, and any other similar noise
              producing device not specified here, shall be
              considered as sources of noise pollution:
              Air conditioners, pumps, fans, furnaces, compressors,
              engines and similar fixed plant equipment.
              Noise measurements shall be made at the boundary of
              the property in which the offending source is located
              or at the boundary line of the complainant.

          (e) Electronic Devices and Musical Instruments

              No person owning, leasing or controlling the operation
              of any electronic device shall willfully or
              negligently permit the establishment or condition of
              noise injury or noise pollution.
              In public spaces, the existence of noise injury or
              noise pollution is to be judged to occur at any
              location a passerby might reasonably occupy.  When the
              offending noise source is located on private property,
              noise injury or noise pollution judgments shall be
              made at the property line within which the offending
              source is located.
              Any and all decibel levels of sound caused by playing
              non-electronic musical instruments between 9 A.M. and
              9 P.M. shall be exempt.

          (f) Animals

              No person owning, keeping or controlling any animal
              shall willfully, negligently or through failure to
              provide necessary equipment or facilities or to take
              necessary precautions, permit the existence of noise
              pollution or noise injury.

          (g) Additional Noise Sources

              No person shall emit noise so as to cause a condition
              of noise pollution or noise injury.

          (h) Alternative Measurement Procedures

              If it is not possible to make a good noise level
              measurement at the distance specified in Section
              8.15.4, measurement may be made at an alternate
              distance and the level at the specified distance
              subsequently calculated.  Calculations shall be made
              in accordance with established engineering procedures.

          (i) Tonal Sound Corrections

              When a tonal sound is emitted by a noise source, the
              limit on maximum noise levels shall be 5 dB lower than
              specified.

          (j) Maximum Noise Level Exclusions

              The following devices shall be exempt from maximum
              noise limitations (for time limits see Section
              8.15.4(a):
                   jack hammers
                   pavement breakers
                   pile drivers
                   rock drills
              providing that effective noise barriers are used to
              shield nearby areas from excessive noise.
              However, noise shields shall not be required for
              devices located on public or private rights of way.

          (k) Motor Vehicle Alarms

              The sounding of any horn or signaling device as a part
              of a burglar, fire or alarm system (alarm) for any
              motor vehicle, unless such alarm is automatically
              terminated within ten minutes of activation and is not
              sounded again at all within the next sixty minutes, is
              prohibited.  Any motor vehicle located on a public or
              private way or on public or private property whose
              alarm has been or continues to sound in excess of ten
              minutes in any sixty minute cycle is hereby deemed to
              be a public nuisance subject to immediate abatement.
              Any police officer who observes that the alarm has or
              is sounding in excess of ten minutes in any sixty
              minute cycle, who, after making a reasonable effort,
              is unable to contact the owner of such motor vehicle
              or, after contact, such owner fails or refuses to
              shut-off or silence the alarm or authorize the police
	      officer to have the alarm shut-off or silenced, may
	      abate the nuisance caused by the alarm by entering the
	      vehicle to shut-off or disconnect the power source of
	      the alarm, by authorizing a member of the fire
	      department or a tow company employee to enter such
	      vehicle to shut-off or disconnect the power source of
	      the alarm and, if such efforts are unsuccessful, such
	      officer is authorized to abate the nuisance by
	      arranging for a tow company to tow the motor vehicle
	      to an approved storage area or other place of safety.
	      If a motor vehicle’s alarm is shut-off or disconnected
	      from its power source and a police officer determines
	      that the motor vehicle is not safe in its then
	      location and condition, the police officer may arrange
	      for a tow company to tow the motor vehicle to an
	      approved storage area or other place of safety.  The
	      registered owner of the motor vehicle shall be
	      responsible for all reasonable costs, charges and
	      expenses incurred for the shutting-off or silencing of
	      the alarm and all costs of the removal and storage of
	      the motor vehicle.  The provisions of Article 10.1
	      shall not apply to paragraph (k).

### SECTION 8.15.5 PERMITS FOR EXEMPTIONS FROM THIS BY-LAW

```
(a)  The Board of Selectmen, or designee, may give a
     special permit for any activity, otherwise forbidden
     by the provisions of this By-law.  A person seeking
     such a permit should make a written application to the
     Board of Selectmen, or designee, on the appropriate
     form which shall be available at the office of the
     Selectmen.
(b)  The Board of Selectmen, or designee, may issue
     guidelines defining the procedures to be followed in
     applying for a special permit. The following criteria
     shall be considered:

     (1) the cost of compliance will not cause the
         applicant excessive financial hardship;

     (2) additional noise will not have an excessive
         impact on neighboring citizens.

(c)  The Board of Selectmen, or designee, may issue
     guidelines defining procedures to be followed in
     applying for an extension of time to comply with the
     provisions of these regulations and the criteria to be
     considered in deciding whether to grant a permit.  The
     guidelines shall include reasonable deadlines for
     compliance.

(d)  In some instances, when it can be demonstrated that
     bringing a source of noise into compliance with the
     provisions of this By-law would create undue hardship
     on a person or the community, a special permit may be
     granted for an exemption from this By-law.  A person
     seeking a special permit shall make written
     application within 5 (five) days of receiving
     notification from the Town that (s)he is in violation
     of the provisions of this By-law.  If the Board of
     Selectmen find that sufficient controversy exists
     regarding the application, a public hearing may be
     held.

(e)  If the Board of Selectmen, or designee, orders
     abatement of a noise source not complying with this
     By-law, a person who feels (s)he cannot meet the
     stated time schedule for compliance may file an
     application for an extension of time.  A written
     application shall be filed within 5 (five) days of
     receipt of notification of violation and shall propose
     a new compliance schedule.  A person who claims that
     the allowance of a extension of time would have
     adverse effects may file a statement with the Board of
     Selectmen, or designee, to support this claim.  If the
     Board of Selectmen, or designee, find that sufficient
     controversy exists regarding the application, a public
     hearing may be held.
```

### SECTION 8.15.6 HEARINGS

```
Resolution of controversy shall be based upon the
information supplied by both sides in support of their
individual claims and shall be in accordance with the
procedures defined in the appropriate guidelines issued by
the Board of Selectmen, or designee.
```

### SECTION 8.15.7 APPEALS

```
Appeals from a decision of the Board of Selectmen, or
designee, shall be to the Superior Court.  Judicial review
shall be limited to whether the decision was supported by
substantial evidence.
```

### SECTION 8.15.8 PENALTIES

```
(a)  Any person who violates any provision of this By-law
     if convicted, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
     shall be fined an amount not to exceed $50.00 (fifty
     dollars), or the offending source shall be confiscated
     by the appropriate agency until the fine is paid, or
     for 60 (sixty) days, whichever is sooner, and, if
     unclaimed, may be sold at auction by the Police
     Department.  Removal and storage costs of the
     offending source shall be in addition to the fine.

(b)  Each day that the offense continues shall be
     considered to be a separate violation.

     involving actual or imminent physical trauma or
     property damage which demands immediate action.

(d)  Emergency Work: Any work performed for the purpose of
     preventing or alleviating the physical trauma or
     property damage threatened or caused by an emergency.

(e)  Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR): The value
     specified by the manufacturer as the recommended
     maximum loaded weight of a single motor vehicle.  In
     cases where trailers and tractors are separable, the
     gross combination weight rating, (GCWR), which is the
     value specified by the manufacturer as the recommended
     maximum loaded weight of the combination vehicle,
     shall be used.

(f)  Motorcycle: Any unenclosed motor vehicle having two or
     three wheels in contact with the ground, including,
     but not limited to, motor scooters and minibikes.

(g)  Motor Vehicle: Any vehicle which is propelled or drawn

     it shall be judged that a condition of noise pollution
     exists.  However, if the noise source is judged by ear
     to have a tonal sound, an increase of 5 dB above
     background noise level is sufficient to cause noise
     pollution.

(k)  Tonal Sound: Any sound that is judged by a listener to
     have the characteristics of a pure tone, whine, hum or
     buzz.
```

### SECTION 8.15.10 SEVERABILITY
