## ARTICLE 8.15<br/>NOISE CONTROL

### SECTION 8.15.1 SHORT TITLE

```
This By-law may be cited as the "Noise Control By-law of The Town of Brookline".
```

### SECTION 8.15.2 DECLARATION OF FINDINGS, POLICY AND SCOPE

```
(a) Whereas excessive Noise is a serious hazard to the public health and welfare,
    safety, and the quality of life; and whereas a substantial body of science and
    technology exists by which excessive Noise may be substantially abated; and
    whereas the people have a right to and should be ensured an environment free
    from excessive Noise that may jeopardize their health or welfare or safety or
    degrade the quality of life; now, therefore, it is the policy of the Town of
    Brookline to prevent excessive Noise which may jeopardize the health and
    welfare or safety of its citizens or degrade the quality of life.

(b) Scope.
    This By-law shall apply to the control of all sound originating within the limits of
    the Town of Brookline.

    1. Provisions in this By-law shall not apply to the emission of sound
       for the purpose of alerting persons to the existence of an
       emergency or to the emission of sound in the performance of
       emergency work or in training exercises related to emergency
       activities, and in the performance of public safety activities.

    2. Emergency generators used for power outages or testing are
       exempt from this By-law.  However, generator testing must be done
       during daylight hours.

    3. Noncommercial public speaking and public assembly activities as
       guaranteed by state and federal constitutions shall be exempt from
       the operation of this By-law.
```

### SECTION 8.15.3 DEFINITIONS

```
(a) Ambient or Background Noise Level: Is the term used to describe the Noise
measured in the absence of the Noise under investigation. It shall be calculated using the
average lowest sound pressure level measured over a period of not less than five minutes
using a sound pressure level meter set for slow response on the “A” weighting filter in a
specific area of the town under investigation.

(b) Construction and Demolition: Any site preparation, assembly erection, substantial
repair, alteration, destruction or similar action for public or private rights-of-way,
structures, utilities, or similar property.

(c) Day: 7:01 AM - 10:59 PM and Night: 11:00 PM – 7:00 AM

(d) Electronic Devices: Any radio, tape recorder, television, CD, stereo, public address
system, loud speaker, amplified musical instrument including a hand held device, and any
other electronic noise producing equipment.

Exemption: two-way communication radios used for emergency, safety and public works
requirements.

(e) Emergencies: Any occurrence or set of circumstances necessary to restore, preserve,
protect or save lives or property from imminent danger of loss or harm.

(f) Decibels (dB): The decibel is used to measure sound pressure level. The dB is a
logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio of sound pressure, loudness, power, voltage and
several other things.

(g) Decibels “A” weighted scale (dBA): The most widely used sound level filter is the
“A” weighted scale. This filter simulates the average human hearing profile.  Using the
“A” weighted scale, the meter is less sensitive to very low and high frequencies.

(h) Decibels “C” weighted scale (dBC): The “C” filter uses little filtering and has nearly
a flat frequency response (equal magnitude of frequencies) throughout the audio range.

(i) Fixed Plant Equipment: Any equipment such as generators, air conditioners,
compressors, engines, pumps, refrigeration units, fans, boilers, heat pumps and similar
equipment.

(j) Frequency response: Is the measure of any system’s response at the output to a signal
of varying frequency but constant amplitude at its input. The theoretical frequency range
for humans is 20 - 20,000 cycles/second (Hz).

(k) Hertz (Hz): Cycles per Second (cps).

(l) Loudness: A rise of 10dB in sound pressure level corresponds approximately to
doubling of subjective loudness. That is, a sound of 65dB is twice as loud as a sound of
55dB.

(m) Leaf blowers: Any powered machine used to blow leaves, dirt and other debris off
lawns, sidewalks, driveways, and other surfaces.

(n) Noise: Sound which a listener does not wish to hear and is under investigation that
may exceed the Noise requirements located in this Noise By-law.

(o) Noise Injury: Any sound that:
    (1) endangers the safety of, or could cause injury to the health of humans; or

    (2) endangers or injures personal or real property.

(p) Noise Level: The Sound Pressure Level measurements shall be made with a Type I
or II sound level meter as specified under American National Standard Institute (ANSI) standards.

(q) Noise Pollution: If a Noise source increases Noise levels 10 dBA or more above the
Background Noise Level, it shall be judged that a condition of Noise Pollution exists.
However, if the Noise source is judged by ear to have a tonal sound, an increase of 5 dBA
above Background Noise Level is sufficient to cause Noise Pollution.

(r) Person: Any individual, company, occupant, real property owner, or agent in control
of real property.

(t) Sound: A fluctuation of air pressure which is propagated as a wave through air.

(u) Sound Level Meter: An instrument meeting Type I or Type II American National
Standard Institute (ANSI) standards, consisting of a microphone, amplifier, filters, and
indicating device, and designed to measure sound pressure levels accurately according to
acceptable engineering practices.

(v) Sound Pressure Level: The level of Noise, normally expressed in decibels, as
measured by a sound level meter.

(w) Tonal Sound: Any sound that is judged by a listener to have the characteristics of a
pure tone, whine, hum or buzz.
```

### SECTION 8.15.3A MOTOR VEHICLE DEFINITIONS

```
(a) Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR): The value specified by the manufacturer as
the recommended maximum loaded weight of a single motor vehicle.  In cases where
trailers and tractors are separable, the gross combination weight rating, (GCWR), which
is the value specified by the manufacturer as the recommended maximum loaded weight
of the combination vehicle, shall be used.

(b) Motorcycle: Any unenclosed motor vehicle having two or three wheels in contact
with the ground, including, but not limited to, motor scooters and minibikes.

(c) Motor Vehicle: Any vehicle which is propelled or drawn on land by a motor, such as,
but not limited to, passenger cars, trucks, truck-trailers, semi-trailers, campers, go-carts,
snowmobiles, dune buggies, or racing vehicles, but not including motorcycles.

```

(c) Fixed Plant Equipment

Any person shall operate such equipment in a manner not to exceed 10 dBA over the
Background Noise and not greater than 5 dBA of Tonal sound over the Background
Noise. However, if the fixed equipment is operated during night time hours, the night
time Sound Pressure Level of the Fixed Plant Equipment must not exceed the average
daytime Background Noise to compensate for night time operations, which is assumed to
be 10dBA below daytime Background Noise. See Definitions Section 8.15.3(c).

Noise measurements shall be made at the boundary of the property in which the
offending source is located, or at the boundary line of the complainant if the complainant
is not a direct abutter.

(e) Electronic Devices and Musical Instruments

No person owning, leasing or controlling the operation of any electronic device shall
willfully or negligently permit the establishment or condition of Noise Injury or Noise
Pollution.

In public spaces, the existence of Noise Injury or Noise Pollution is to be judged to occur
at any location a passerby might reasonably occupy. When the offending Noise source is
located on private property, Noise Injury or Noise Pollution judgments shall be made at
the property line within which the offending source is located.

Any and all Decibel Levels of sound caused by playing non-electrified musical
instruments between 9 A.M. and 9 P.M. shall be exempt with exception of drums.

(f) Leaf Blowers

No person shall operate any portable Leaf Blower(s) which does not bear an affixed
manufacturer’s label or a label from the town indicating the model number of the Leaf
Blower(s) and designating a Noise Level not in excess of sixty-seven(67)dBA when
measured from a distance of fifty feet utilizing American National Standard Institute
(ANSI) methodology. Any Leaf Blower(s) which bears such a manufacturer’s label or
town’s label shall be presumed to comply with the approved ANSI Noise Level limit
under this By-law. However, any Leaf Blowers must be operated as per the operating
instructions provided by the manufacturer. Any modifications to the equipment or label
are prohibited. However, any portable Leaf Blower(s) that have been modified or
damaged, determined visually by anyone who has enforcement authority for this By-law,
may be required to have the unit tested by the town as provided for in this section, even if
the unit has an affixed manufacturer’s ANSI or town label. Any portable Leaf Blower(s)
must comply with the labeling provisions of this By-law by January 1, 2010. However,
the owner’s of any Leaf Blower(s) operating after January 1, 2010 without a
manufacturer’s ANSI label on the equipment, may obtain a label from the town by
bringing the equipment to the town’s municipal vehicle service center or such other
facility designated by the Town for testing. The testing will be provided by the town’s
designated person for a nominal fee and by appointment only. Testing will be provided
only between the months of May and October. If the equipment passes, a town label will
be affixed to the equipment indicating Decibel Level.

Whether the equipment passes or not, the testing fee is non- refundable. Leaf blowers
may be operated only during the hours specified in Section 8.15.6(a)(1).  In the event that
the label has been destroyed, the Town may replace the label after verifying the
specifications listed in the owner’s manual that it meets the requirements of this By-law.

(g) Animals

No person owning, keeping or controlling any animal shall willfully, negligently or
through failure to provide necessary equipment or facilities or to take necessary
precautions, permit the existence of Noise Pollution or Noise Injury.

(h) Additional Noise Sources

No person shall emit noise so as to cause a condition of Noise Pollution or Noise Injury.

(i) Alternative Measurement Procedures

If it is not possible to make a good Sound Pressure Level measurement at the distance as
defined for specific equipment throughout Article 8.15, measurement may be made at an
alternate distance and the level at the specified distance subsequently calculated.
Calculations shall be made in accordance with established engineering procedures.

(j) Noise Level Exclusions

Any equipment that is used to satisfy local, state, federal health, welfare, environmental
or safety codes shall be exempt from limitations for hours of operation (See Section
8.15.6(a)), except to the extent otherwise determined by the Board of Selectman.  The
following equipment shall also be exempt from Section 8.15.6(a) if necessary for
emergency work performed by the Department of Public Works:
    jack hammers
    pavement breakers
    pile drivers
    rock drills
    or such other equipment as the DPW deems necessary,
providing that effective Noise barriers are used to shield nearby areas from excessive
Noise.

(k) Motor Vehicle Alarms

The sounding of any horn or signaling device as a part of a burglar, fire or alarm system
(alarm) for any motor vehicle, unless such alarm is automatically terminated within ten
minutes of activation and is not sounded again at all within the next sixty minutes, is
prohibited. Any motor vehicle located on a public or private way or on public or private
property whose alarm has been or continues to sound in excess of ten minutes in any
sixty minute cycle is hereby deemed to be a public nuisance subject to immediate
abatement. Any police officer who observes that the alarm has or is sounding in excess
of ten minutes in any sixty minute cycle, who, after making a reasonable effort, is unable
to contact the owner of such motor vehicle or, after contact, such owner fails or refuses
to shut-off or silence the alarm or authorize the police officer to have the alarm shut-off or
silenced, may abate the nuisance caused by the alarm by entering the vehicle to shut off
or disconnect the power source of the alarm, by authorizing a member of the fire
department or a tow company employee to enter such vehicle to shut off or disconnect
the power source of the alarm and, if such efforts are unsuccessful, such officer is
authorized to abate the nuisance by arranging for a tow company to tow the motor vehicle
to an approved storage area or other place of safety. If a motor vehicle’s alarm is shut off
or disconnected from its power source and a police officer determines that the motor
vehicle is not safe in its then location and condition, the police officer may arrange for a
tow company to tow the motor vehicle to an approved storage area or other place of
safety.  The registered owner of the motor vehicle shall be responsible for all reasonable
costs, charges and expenses incurred for the shutting-off or silencing of the alarm and all
costs of the removal and storage of the motor vehicle. The provisions of Article 10.1 or
Section 8.15.10 shall not apply to this paragraph (k).

(l) Tonal Sound Corrections

When a Tonal Sound is emitted by a Noise source, the limit on maximum Noise levels
shall be 5 dB lower than specified.
```

### SECTION 8.15.7 PERMITS FOR EXEMPTIONS FROM THIS BY-LAW
