barter or taking on consignment of junk, antiques or second
hand articles without a license, issued by the Town

     check to determine if the applicant is a suitable
     person to deal in junk and second hand articles.

     the license in a conspicuous place at his or her place
     of business.

(c)  No person shall conduct a business, under a license

     articles under his or her license from a minor.
