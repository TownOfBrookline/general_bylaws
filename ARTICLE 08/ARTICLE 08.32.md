## ARTICLE 8.32<BR/>PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF POLYSTYRENE BASED DISPOSABLE FOOD CONTAINERS

```
Effective December 1, 2013, polystyrene food or beverage
containers shall not be used in the Town of Brookline to
package or serve food or beverages if that packaging takes
place on the premises of food service establishments, as
defined in Article 8.10.2, within the Town of Brookline.

In the event that compliance with the effective date of
this by-law is not feasible for a food service
establishment because of either unavailability of
alternative non-polystyrene containers or economic
hardship, the Director of Health and Human Services may
grant a waiver of not more than six months upon application
of the owner or the ownerâ€™s representative. The waiver may
be extended for one (1) additional 6 month period upon the
showing of continued infeasibility as set forth above.

And by adding a reference to this Article 8.32 in the
General By-Laws, Article 10.2 Prosecutions and Enforcement,
by including Article 8.32 under the list of by-laws
enforceable by the Director of Health and Human Services.
