Any person owning or harboring a dog shall not suffer or

the owner or occupant of such premises grants permission.
Under no circumstances shall a dog, even on a leash, be
allowed on private property, unless specific permission has
been granted.  No dog shall be permitted in any public
place or street within the Town of Brookline unless it is
effectively restrained by a chain or leash not exceeding 7
feet in length.

However, in areas officially designated as designated off
leash area by the Park and Recreation Commission, or its

the following conditions:

   under the control of a person;

3. the person in charge of a dog inside a
   designated off leash area must remove any fecal
   material deposited by that dog in the designated off
   leash area, before taking the dog from the
   designated off leash area; and

4. the person in charge of a dog inside a designated
   off leash area must control the animal so that it
   does not disturb the surrounding area by barking
   or other action and so that it does not disturb
   or threaten others using the designated off leash
   area and the area surrounding the designated off
   leash area.

   Italized language in Section 8.6.7(a)above will
   revert to language existing immediately prior

controls a dog to pick up and dispose of any feces left by
such dog on any sidewalk, tree lawn, gutter, street, park
or other public area, or on any private property that is
not owned or occupied by such person.  No person owning,
possessing or controlling a dog shall appear with such dog
on any sidewalk, tree lawn, gutter, street, park or other
public area without having the means of removal of any
feces left by such dog in his or her possession.  For the
