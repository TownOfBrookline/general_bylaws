       establishment shall notify every applicant for

       or otherwise discriminate against any employee or
       applicant for employment by reason of such person's

       exposure unless the employee has been hired for a
       designated smoking position and has been so notified
       in writing at the time of hiring.

   (7) It is the intent of this by-law that a designated
       smoking position shall not be considered suitable work
       for purposes of M.G.L. c. 151A, and that an employee
       who is required to work in a smoking position shall
       have good cause attributable to the employer for
       leaving work.

       pursuant to 8.23.3(b)(2)(b) shall post, and make
