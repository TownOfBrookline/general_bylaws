       The restriction of smoking in taxi/livery vehicles
       applies to drivers as well as passengers.  Vehicles

       status can be readily determined from the outside of
       the vehicle.

   (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), smoking may be
       permitted in the following places and circumstances:

       when the residence is utilized as part of a
       business as a group childcare center, school age

   (3) Hotels must establish and post a workplace policy
       that states "Employees are not required to work in
       rooms in which smoking is allowed." Employees who do

       employees' stated wishes in this regard.

   (4) Every establishment in which smoking is permitted
       pursuant to this by-law shall designate all positions
       where the employee’s presence in an area in which
       smoking is permitted to be "smoking positions."  The
       establishment shall notify every applicant for
       employment in a smoking position, in writing, that the
       position may cause continuous exposure to secondhand
       smoke, which may be hazardous to the employee’s

   (6) No establishment in which smoking is permitted
       pursuant to this by-law may discharge, refuse to hire,
       or otherwise discriminate against any employee or
       applicant for employment by reason of such person's
       unwillingness to be subjected to secondhand smoke
       exposure unless the employee has been hired for a
       designated smoking position and has been so notified
       in writing at the time of hiring.

   (7) It is the intent of this by-law that a designated
       smoking position shall not be considered suitable work
       for purposes of M.G.L. c. 151A, and that an employee
       who is required to work in a smoking position shall
       have good cause attributable to the employer for
       leaving work.

   (8) Each establishment in which smoking is permitted
       pursuant to 8.23.3(b)(2)(b) shall post, and make
