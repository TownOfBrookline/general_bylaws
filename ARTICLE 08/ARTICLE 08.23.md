          shall, upon request, furnish a written copy
          of such smoking policy to any employee or to

          smoking policy shall include a grievance
          procedure whereby an employee may seek
          relief if he/she is exposed to tobacco smoke
          in the course of his/her work duties. Upon
          written request by three or more employees,
          an employer may, but is not required to,
          designate a "Smoking Area", provided that
          such a smoking area shall not adversely
          affect the health and well being of non-
          smoking employees or members of the public.
          An employer may furnish a separate employee
          lounge for smoking, no larger in floor area

          before January 1, 1995.

     2.   Workplaces with function rooms must
          establish and post a workplace policy that
          states "Employees are not required to work
          at private functions in which smoking is
          allowed." Employees who do not want to work
          at such functions must so inform their
          employer in writing, and employers must
          abide by their employees stated wishes in
          this regard.

     3.   Hotels must establish and post a workplace
          policy that states "Employees are not
          required to work in rooms in which smoking
          is allowed." Employees who do not want to
          work in such rooms must so inform their
          employer in writing, and employers must
          abide by their employees' stated wishes in
          this regard.

     4.   Food service establishments that permit
          smoking under the waiver provisions of
          Section 8.23.2 (2) shall establish and post
          a workplace policy that states:
          "Employees are not required to work in the
          bar/lounge.

     5.   Every establishment in which smoking is
          permitted pursuant to this Bylaw shall
          designate all positions that require the
          employee’s presence in an area in which
          smoking is permitted to be "smoking
          positions." The establishment shall notify
          every applicant for employment in a smoking
          position, in writing, that the
          position requires continuous exposure to
          secondhand smoke, which may be
          hazardous to the employees health.

     6.   No establishment in which smoking is
          permitted pursuant to this By-Law may
          require any employee whose effective date of
          employment was on or November
          1, 1994 to accept a designated smoking
          position as a condition of continued
          employment by the employer.

     7.   No establishment in which smoking is
          permitted pursuant to this Bylaw may
          discharge, refuse to hire, or otherwise
          discriminate against any employee or
          applicant for employment by reason of such
          person's unwillingness to be subjected to
          secondhand smoke exposure unless the
          employee has been hired for a designated
          smoking position and has been so notified in
          writing at the time of hiring.

     8.   No establishment in which smoking is
          permitted pursuant to this Bylaw may
          designate more smoking positions, as a
          proportion of the total number of service
          positions, than the number of seats in
          portion of the establishment in which
          smoking is permitted bears to the total
          number of seats legally permitted in the
          establishment.

     9.   It is the intent of this Bylaw that a
          designated smoking position shall not be
          considered suitable work for purposes of
          G.L.C. 151A, and that an employee who is
          required to work in a smoking position shall
          have good cause attributable to the employer
          for leaving work.

     10.  Each establishment in which smoking is
          permitted pursuant to this Bylaw shall post,
          and make available to all job applicants, a
          statement inviting employees and job
          applicants to notify the Board of Selectmen
          regarding any violation of the policies in
          this section (Workplaces).
