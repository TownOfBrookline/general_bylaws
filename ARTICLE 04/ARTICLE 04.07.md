## ARTICLE 4.7<br/>NONPAYMENT OF LOCAL TAXES, FEES & CHARGES

### SECTION 4.7.1 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF LOCAL LICENSE OR PERMIT

```
(a)  The local licensing authority may deny any application
     for, or revoke or suspend any local license or permit
     including renewals and transfers for any person who
     has neglected or refused to pay any local taxes, fees,
     assessments, betterments or any other municipal
     charges.  This By-Law shall not apply to those
     licenses and permits exempted from regulation
     hereunder by G.L. c.40, ยง57, as amended.

(b)  The tax collector or other municipal official
     responsible for records of all municipal taxes,
     assessments, betterments and other municipal charges,
     hereinafter referred to as the tax collector, shall
     annually furnish to each department, board, commission
     or division, hereinafter referred to as the licensing
     authority, that issues licenses or permits including
     renewals and transfers, a list of any person,
     corporation, or business enterprise, hereinafter
     referred to as the party, that has neglected or
     refused to pay any local taxes, fees, assessments,
     betterments or other municipal charges for not less
     than a twelve month period, and that such party has
     not filed in good faith a pending application for an
     abatement of such tax or a pending petition before the
     appellate tax board.

(c)  The licensing authority may deny, revoke or suspend
     any license or permit, including renewals and
     transfers of any party whose name appears on said list
     furnished to the licensing authority from the tax
     collector or with respect to any activity, event or
     other matter which is the subject of such license or
     permit and which activity, event or matter is carried
     out or exercised or is to be carried out or exercised
     on or about real estate owned by any party whose name
     appears on said list furnished to the licensing
     authority from the tax collector; provided, however,
     that written notice is given to the party and the tax
     collector, as required by applicable provisions of
     law, and the party is given a hearing, to be held not
     earlier than fourteen days after said notice.  Said
     list shall be prima facie evidence for denial,
     revocation or suspension of said license or permit to
     any party.  The tax collector shall have the right to
     intervene in any hearing conducted with respect to
     such license denial, revocation or suspension.  Any
     findings made by the licensing authority with respect
     to such license denial, revocation or suspension shall
     be made only for the purposes of such proceeding and
     shall not be relevant to or introduced in any other
     proceeding at law, except for any appeal from such
     license denial, revocation or suspension.  Any license
     or permit denied, suspended or revoked under this
     section shall not be reissued or renewed until the
     license authority receives a certificate issued by the
     tax collector that the party is in good standing with
     respect to any and all local taxes, fees, assessments,
     betterments or other municipal charges, payable to the
     municipality as the date of issuance of said
     certificate.

(d)  Any party shall be given an opportunity to enter into
     a payment agreement, thereby allowing the licensing
     authority to issue a certificate indicating said
     limitations to the license or permit and the validity
     of said license shall be conditioned upon the
     satisfactory compliance with said agreement.  Failure
     to comply with said agreement shall be grounds for the
     suspension or revocation of said license or permit;
     provided, however, that the holder be given notice and
     a hearing as required by applicable provisions of law.

(e)  The Board of Selectmen may waive such denial,
     suspension or revocation if it finds there is not
     direct or indirect business interest by the property
     owner, its officers or stockholders, if any, or
     members of his immediate family, as defined in section
     one of chapter two hundred and sixty-eight A in the
     business or activity conducted in or on said property.
