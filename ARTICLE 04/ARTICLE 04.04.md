## ARTICLE 4.4<br/>FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO CONTRACTS

### SECTION 4.4.1 CONTRACT PROVISIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

```
Subject to the exceptions hereinafter stated, all contracts
awarded by the Town and all agencies and departments
thereof, shall include the following provisions:

During the performance of this Contract, the Contractor,
for himself, his assignees and successors in interest
(hereinafter referred to as the "Contractor"), agrees as
follows:

(a)  The Contractor will comply with the provisions of
     Chapter 151B, as amended, of  the General Laws of
     Massachusetts relative to non-discrimination which are
     incorporated herein by reference and made a part of
     this Contract.

(b)  In the performance of work under this Contract, the
     Contractor shall not discriminate in employment
     practices or in the selection or retention of
     subcontractors or in the procurement of materials or
     rental of equipment on the grounds of race, color,
     religion, or national origin, or on the grounds of age
     or sex except when age or sex is a bona fide
     occupational qualification.<br/>
     The Contractor will send to each labor union or
     representative of workers with which he has a
     collective bargaining agreement or other contract or
     understanding, a notice advising the said labor union
     or workers' representative of the Contractor's
     commitments under this section, and shall post copies
     of such notice in conspicuous places available to
     employees and applicants for employment.

(c)  In all solicitations either by competitive bidding or
     negotiation made by the Contractor for work to be
     performed under a subcontract and for the procurement
     of materials and equipment, each potential
     subcontractor or supplier shall be notified in writing
     by the Contractor of the Contractor's obligations
     under this Contract relative to non-discrimination on
     grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, age
     or sex, and his obligations to pursue an affirmative
     course of action as required by paragraph (d).

(d)  The Contractor will pursue an affirmative course of
     action as required by affirmative action guidelines
     adopted by the Human Relations Commission in effect on
     the effective date of the contract, or when calls for
     proposals are made, whichever is sooner, which are
     herein incorporated by reference, attached hereto, and
     made a part of this contract and to the nature and
     size of his work force, to insure that applicants are
     sought and employed, and that employees are treated,
     during their employment, without regard to their race,
     color, national origin or ancestry, or religion.  No
     changes in affirmative action guidelines hereinafter
     adopted by the Commission shall be effective with
     respect to contracts already in effect, without the
     express written consent of the contractor.

(e)  In the event the Contractor fails to comply with the
     foregoing non-discrimination provisions of this
     Contract, the contracting agency of the Town, upon
     advice and counsel of the Human Relations Commission,
     shall impose such contract sanctions as it may
     determine to be appropriate, including but not limited
     to:<br/>
     (1)  withholding of payment due the Contractor under
          this contract until the Contractor complies,
          and/or<br/>
     (2)  cancellation, termination or suspension of this
          Contract, in whole or in part.<br/>
     For the purposes of this section the contracting
     agency of the Town shall accept as proof of
     noncompliance with the provisions of Section 4.4.1(a),
     only final orders or decisions of the Massachusetts
     Commission Against Discrimination.

(f)  The provisions of this section shall be deemed
     supplementary to, and not in lieu of, or in
     substitution for, the provisions of Massachusetts Law
     relating to non-discrimination, and other applicable
     Federal, State or Town law, by-law, rule, regulation
     and directive relative thereto.  In the event of a
     conflict between the provisions of this section and,
     where inserted or incorporated in this contract, an
     applicable state or federal law, rule, regulation or
     directive, the conflicting provisions of the latter
     shall control.
